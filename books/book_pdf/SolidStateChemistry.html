<h1> Solid State Chemistry</h1>
<p>
SOLIDS : Solids are characterised by definite shape, volume, rigidity, high density, low compressibility, mechanical strength, slow diffusion etc.
<br>Solids can be classified into two types:
<p>
Crystalline Solids : Here, constituent particles are arranged in definite geometrical pattern in three dimension.
</p>
<p>
Amorphous Solids : Here, constituent particles are in random arrangement. (amorphous - means without any form).
</p>
