<h1>Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry</h1>
<b>Precision and accuracy of measurement:</b><br>
Accuracy and precision are two measures of observational error. <b>Accuracy</b> is how close a given set of measurements (observations or readings) are to their true value, while <b>precision</b> is how close the measurements are to each other.

In other words, precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability.<br>
We can erxplain the concept by taking the following example.<br>
Let, the true weight of a substance be 3.0 g. Measurements carried out by three students A,B, and C are shown below:<br>

Case of student A : Measurements are precise but not accurate.<br>
Case of student : Measurements are precise as well as accurate. <br>

</ol>
<p> Ans:c </p>

<b>Significant Figures :</b>
Uncertainty in measured value leads to uncertainty in calculated result. Uncertainty in a value is indicated by mentioning the number of significant figures in that value. Consider, the column reading 10.2 ± 0.1 mL recorded on a burette having the least count of 0.1 mL. Here it is said that the last digit ‘2’ in the reading is uncertain, its uncertainty is ±0.1 mL. On the other hand, the figure ‘10’ is certain.
<em>The significant figures in a measurement or result are the number of digits known with certainty plus one uncertain digit.</em>
<br><br>
<b>Rules for deciding significant figures :</b><br>

1.	All non zero digits are significant; e. g. 127.34 g contains five significant figures which are 1, 2, 7, 3 and 4.<br>

2.	All zeros between two non zero digits are significant e. g. 120.007 m contains six significant figures.<br>

3.	Zeroes on the left of the first non zero digit are not significant. Such a zero indicates the position of the decimal point. For example, 0.025 has two significant figures.<br>
 
4.	Zeroes at the end of a number are significant if they are on the right side of the decimal point. Terminal zeros are not significant if there is no decimal point. (This is beacause the least count of an instrument contains decimal point) For example 0.400 g has three singnificant figures. The measurements here indicates that it is made on a weighing machine having least count of 0.001 g.
Significant figures are also indicated in scientific notation by means of decimal point. For example, the measurment 400 g has one significant figure. The measurement 4.0 × 10<sup>2</sup> g has two significant figures, wheras the measurment 4.00 × 10<sup>2</sup> g has three significant figures. The zeros after the decimal points in these cases indicates that the least counts of the weighing machines are 1 g, 0.1 g and 0.01 g, respectively.<br>

5.	In numbers written is scientific notation, all digits are significant. For example, 2.035×10<sup>2</sup>
has four significant figures.

</div>
<p>
<b>Rounding off :</b>
The following rules are observed.<br>
(a)	If the digit after the last digit to be retained is less than 5, the last digit is retained as such e.g. 1.752 = 1.75 (2 is less than 5).
<br>(b)	If the digit after the last digit to be retained is more than 5, the digit to be retained is increased by 1 e.g. 1.756 = 1.76 (6 is more than 5).
<br>(c)	If the digit after the last digit to be retained is equal to 5, the last digit is retained as such if it is even and increased by 1 if odd.
<br>e.g. 1.755 should be 1.76 and 1.745 should be 1.74 after rounding off.

<br><b>Calculations involving addition and substraction :</b>
<br>(i)	In case of addition and substraction the final result should be reported to the same number of decimal places as the number with the minimum number of decimal places e.g. 34.72 (has two decimal places) + 8.1 (has one decimal place) = 42.82, but it should have only one decimal place so answer is 42.8.
<br>(ii)	<b>Calculations involving multiplication and division :</b> In this case the final result should be reported having same number of significant digits as that of the number having least significant digits. Example : 9.24 × 3.6 = 33.264 Rounded off to 33.
<br>(iii)	In case of division 5.235 /13.1 = 0.3996 , rounded off to 0.400.

<p>Ans:a</p>

</div>
<p>
<b>Laws of Chemical Combination </b>: The elements combine with each other and form compounds. This process is governed by five basic laws discovered before the knowledge of molecular formulae.
</p>
<p><b>Law of conservation of mass:</b> Mass can neither be created nor destroyed, and Total mass of reactants = Total mass of products.
</p>
<p>In reality, the conservation of mass only holds approximately and is considered part of a series of assumptions in classical mechanics. The law has to be modified to comply with the laws of quantum mechanics and special relativity under the principle of mass–energy equivalence, which states that energy and mass form one conserved quantity. For very energetic systems the conservation of mass only is shown not to hold, as is the case in nuclear reactions and particle-antiparticle annihilation in particle physics.
</p>
<p>Mass is also not generally conserved in open systems. Such is the case when various forms of energy and matter are allowed into, or out of, the system. However, unless radioactivity or nuclear reactions are involved, the amount of energy escaping (or entering) such systems as heat, mechanical work, or electromagnetic radiation is usually too small to be measured as a decrease (or increase) in the mass of the system.
</p>
<p>For systems that include large gravitational fields, general relativity has to be taken into account; thus mass–energy conservation becomes a more complex concept, subject to different definitions, and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity.
</p>
<b>Law of Definite Proportions :</b>A given compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by weight irrespective of source and method of preparation..
<p>For example, oxygen makes up about 8/9 of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen makes up the remaining 1/9 of the mass: the mass of two elements in a compound are always in the same ratio. Along with the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions forms the basis of stoichiometry.
</p>
<p>Although very useful in the foundation of modern chemistry, the law of definite proportions is not universally true. There exist non-stoichiometric compounds whose elemental composition can vary from sample to sample. Such compounds follow the law of multiple proportion. An example is the iron oxide wüstite, which can contain between 0.83 and 0.95 iron atoms for every oxygen atom, and thus contain anywhere between 23% and 25% oxygen by mass. The ideal formula is FeO, but due to crystallographic vacancies it is about Fe<sub>0.95O</sub>. In general, Proust's measurements were not precise enough to detect such variations.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the isotopic composition of an element can vary depending on its source, hence its contribution to the mass of even a pure stoichiometric compound may vary. This variation is used in radiometric dating since astronomical, atmospheric, oceanic, crustal and deep Earth processes may concentrate some environmental isotopes preferentially. With the exception of hydrogen and its isotopes, the effect is usually small, but is measurable with modern-day instrumentation.
</p>
<p>
Many natural polymers vary in composition (for instance DNA, proteins, carbohydrates) even when "pure". Polymers are generally not considered "pure chemical compounds" except when their molecular weight is uniform (mono-disperse) and their stoichiometry is constant. In this unusual case, they still may violate the law due to isotopic variations.
</p>
<b>Law of multiple proportions :</b>When two elements A and B comine to form more than one compound, the masses of element B that combine with a given mass of A are always in the ratio of small whole numbers
<p>
An example of the law can be seen by comparing ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) with propane (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>). The weight of hydrogen which combines with 1 g carbon is 0.252 g in ethane and 0.224 g in propane. The ratio of those weights is 1.125, which can be expressed as the ratio of two small numbers 9:8.
</p>
<p>
The law of multiple proportions is best demonstrated using simple compounds. For example, if one tried to demonstrate it using the hydrocarbons decane (chemical formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>22</sub>) and undecane (C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>24</sub>), one would find that 100 grams of carbon could react with 18.46 grams of hydrogen to produce decane or with 18.31 grams of hydrogen to produce undecane, for a ratio of hydrogen masses of 121:120, which is hardly a ratio of "small" whole numbers.

<br>The law fails with non-stoichiometric compounds and also doesn't work well with polymers and oligomers.
</p>
<b>Law of Reciprocal proportions: </b>If two different elements combine separately with a fixed mass of a third element, the ratio of the masses in which they do so are either
 
the same as or a simple multiple of the ratio of the masses in which they combine with each other.
<p>
For example:

Consider 3 grams of C reacting with 1 g of H to form methane and 8 g of O reacting with 1 g of H to form water.<br>
Here, the mass ratio of carbon and oxygen is 3:8.<br>
Similarly, 12 g of C reacts with 32 g of O to form CO<sub>2</sub> in which case the mass ratio of carbon and oxygen is 12:32 = 3:8
<br>The mass ratio in which C and O combine with each other is the same as the mass ratio in which they separately combine with a fixed mass of H
</p>
<p>
The acceptance of the law allowed tables of element equivalent weights to be drawn up. These equivalent weights were widely used by chemists in the 19th century.
</p>
<b>Gay Lussac Law of Gaseous Volume :</b> When gases combine or are produced in a chemical reaction they do so in a simple ratio by volume, provided all gases are at same temperature and pressure.
<p>
For example, Gay-Lussac found that two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen would react to form two volumes of gaseous water. 
<br>Thus, the volumes of hydrogen and oxygen which combine bear a simple ratio of 2:1.
</p>
<b>Avogadro Law :</b> Equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules.
<p>
As an example, equal volumes of gaseous hydrogen and nitrogen contain the same number of molecules when they are at the same temperature and pressure, and observe ideal gas behavior. In practice, real gases show small deviations from the ideal behavior and the law holds only approximately, but is still a useful approximation for scientists.

<ul><b>Dalton's Atomic Theory :</b>
<li>Matter consists of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms.</li>
<li>All the atoms of a given elements have identical properties including mass. Atoms of different elements differ in mass.</li>
<li>Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in a fixed ratio.</li>
<li>Chemical reactions involve only the reorganization of atoms. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Dalton's theory could explain all the laws of chemical combination.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Atomic Mass :</b> Atomic mass is the mass of an atom. It is actually very very small and not easy to measure. 
In the present system, mass of an atom is determined relative to the mass of a carbon - 12 atom as the standard. 
The atomic masses are expressed in amu. 
One amu is defined as a mass exactly equal to one twelfth of the mass of one carbon-12 atom.
<br>1 amu = 1/12 × mass of one C-12
<br>= 1 /12 × 1.992648 × 10<sup>-23</sup> g
<br>= 1.66056 × 10<sup>-24</sup> g
<br>Recently, amu has been replaced by unified mass unit called dalton (symbol 'u' or 'Da'), 'u' means unified mass.
</p>
<p>
<b>Average Atomic Mass :</b>Many naturally occuring elements exist as mixture of more than one isotope. Isotopes have different atomic masses. The atomic mass of such an element is the weighted average of atomic masses of its isotopes (taking into account the atomic masses of isotopes and their relative abundance i.e. percent occurrance). This is called average atomic mass of an element.
For example the average atomic mass of carbon<br>
= (12 u) (98.892/100) + (13.00335 u) (1.108/100) + (14.00317) (2 × 10<sup>-10</sup>/100)
</p>

<p>
<b>Molecular Mass :</b> Molecular mass of a substance is the sum of average atomic masses of all the atoms of elements which constitute the molecule. Molecular mass of a substance is the mass of one molecule of that substance relative to the mass of one carbon-12 atom.
</p>
<p>
<b>Formula Mass:</b> Some substances such as sodium chloride do not contain discrete molecules as the constituent units. In such compounds, cationic (sodium) and anionic (chloride) entities are arranged in a three dimensional structure, NaCl is the formula used to represent sodium chloride, though it is not a molecule. The formula mass of a substance is the sum of atomic masses of the atoms present in the formula.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mole :</b>One mole is the amount of a substance that contains as many entities or particles as there are atoms in exactly 12 g (or 0.012 kg) of the carbon -12 isotope.
</p>
<p>
<b>Moles and gases :</b> ''One mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 dm<sup>3</sup> at standard temperature (00 C) and pressure (1 atm) (STP). The volume of
22.4 dm<sup>3</sup> at STP is known as molar volume of a gas.
</p>
<p>
<b>Molar Mass :</b> The mass of one mole of a substance (element/compound) in grams is called its molar mass

<p>
<b>Concentration of solution:</b> The concerntration of a solution or the amount of substance present in given volume of a solution can be expressed in any of the following ways :<br>
1.	Mass percent or weight percent (w/w %)<br>
2.	Mole fraction<br>
3.	Molarity (M)<br>
4.	Molality (m)
</p>
<p>
<b>Mass percent :</b> It is obtained by using following relation:<br>
Mass percent = (Mass of solute /Mass of solution) × 100 %<br>

<br><b>Mole fraction: </b>It is the ratio of number of moles of a particular component of a solution to the total number of moles of the solution.<br>

<br><b>Molarity:</b>It is the most wideley used unit and is denoted by M. It is defined as the number of moles of the solute present in 1 litre of the solution . Thus,<br>
Molarity (M) = No. of moles of solute/ Volume of solution in litres<br>

<br><b>Molality: </b>It is defined as the number of moles of solute present in 1 kg of solvent. It is denoted by m.<br>
Molality (m) = No. of moles of solute / Mass of solvent in kg<br>
Note that molality of a solution does not change with temperature since mass remains unaffected with temperature.<br>

<br><b>Normality :</b> It is the number of gram equivalents of a solute present in one litre of solution,<br>
Normality = Gram equivalents of solute / Volume of solution in litre

</p>
<p>
<b>Calculation of Normality in Titration:</b><br>
Titration is the process of gradual addition of a solution of a known concentration and volume with another solution of 
unknown concentration until the reaction approaches its neutralisation. To find the normality of the acid and base titration,<br>
N<sub>1</sub> V<sub>1</sub> = N<sub>2</sub> V<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Where,<br>

N<sub>1</sub> = Normality of the Acidic solution<br>
V<sub>1</sub> = Volume of the Acidic solution<br>
N<sub>2</sub> = Normality of the basic solution<br>
V<sub>2</sub> = Volume of the basic solution
</p>
<p>
<b>Relation between Normality and Molarity:</b><br>
Normality = [Molarity × Molar mass] × [Equivalent mass]<sup>-1</sup><br>
For acids, Normality = Molarity × Basicity and for bases, 
Normality = Molarity × Acidity

<b>Empirical Formula :</b> It is the simplest formula of a compound giving simplest whole number ratio of atoms present in one molecule. e.g. CH is empirical formula of benzene.
<br>
<em>Steps for Empirical Formula Calculation:</em> <br>
There are the following steps in the experimental calculation of the empirical formula.<br>

1. The percentage composition of each element by weight should be determined.<br>

2. The percentage of each element should be divided by its atomic weight to get relative number of atoms of each element.<br>

3. The numbers obtained in step-2 should be divided to get the simplest ratio.<br>
4. If the numbers obtained in step-3 are not whole numbers, they should be multiplied by suitable integers to get the whole number ratio.<br>
5. The ratio obtained in step-4 gives the Empirical formula.

</p>
<p><b>Molecular Formula :</b> It is the actual formula of a compound showing the exact number of atoms of constituent elements e.g. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is molecular formula of benzene.
<br>Molecular formula = n × empirical formula, where n is simple whole number.<br>
n=Molecular weight/Empirical formula weight<br>

<b>DETERMINATION OF ATOMIC MASS :</b><br><br>
(i)	<b>Dulong and petit's rule :</b> It is based on experimental facts. "At ordinary temperature, product of atomic mass and specific heat for solid elements is approximately 6.4 and this product is known as atomic heat of the element".
<br>Atomic mass × specific heat = 6.4
The law is valid for solid elements except Be, B, Si and C.<br>
Correct Atomic mass = Equivalent mass × valency

<br><br>(ii) <b>Vapour density method</b> is suitable for elements having volatile chlorides. Atomic mass = Equivalent mass of metal × valency.

<br><br>(iii) <b>Mitscherlich's law of isomorphism :</b> It states that isomorphous substances have similar chemical constitution. Isomorphous substances form crystals of same shape and valencies of elements forming isomorphous salts are also same. eg: ZnSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, MgSO<sub>4</sub> .7H<sub>2</sub>O and FeSO<sub>4</sub> .7H<sub>2</sub>O are isomorphous.

<b>Stoichiometric problems</b>:<br>
Generally problems based on stoichiometry are of the following types :<br>
a. Problems based on mass-mass relationship;<br>
b. Problems based on mass-volume relationship and<br>
c. Problems based on volume-volume relationship.
<br>d. <b>Eudiometry</b> or “gas analysis” involves a calculation based on gaseous reactions in which at least two components are gases & their amount is given in terms of volumes measured at same pressure & Temperature.
 The relationship amongst gases, when they react with one another, is governed by two laws, namely Gay-Lussac law and Avogadro’s law.
</p>
<p>
<b>Concept of Limiting Reagent:</b>
In the reactions where more than one reactant is involved, one has first to identify the <b>limiting reagent, i.e.the reactant which is completely consumed first.</b>
All calculations must be done with the amount of limiting reagent. Let us take an example to identify limiting reagent.<br>
<br>
Intitially -----&nbsp&nbsp 5 mol &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      12 mol  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp			0 mol<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp				  A&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		+  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  2B&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	→&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp		4C	<br>
If A is the limiting reagent the moles of C produced will be =20 <br>
If B is the limiting reagent the moles of C produced will be =24 <br>	
The reactant producing least number of moles of product is the limiting reagent. So, A is the limiting reagent in this case.			  
</p>

<p>
<b>Principle of Atom Conservation:</b><br>
Atoms are conserved in chemical reaction, hence moles of atoms must be conserved as well. 
This is known as the atomic conservation principle. The Law of Conservation of Mass is used to generate the POAC: 
Principle Of Atom Conservation. The mass of an element's atoms in the reactant equals the mass of an element's atoms 
in the product. Moles of atoms of an element in a product = Moles of atoms of an element in the reactant.<br><br>


This technique can be applied to practically any stoichiometric calculations to solve difficulties.
 It is based on the conservation of a mole of an atom or  mass of an atom. If the POAC rule  is obtained, 
 the chemical equation does not need to be balanced.<br>
 Let us explain the concept by taking a suitable example<br>
 KClO<sub>3</sub> → KCl + O<sub>2</sub>, in this reaction if we apply POAC for oxygen then we can write<br>
 Number of moles of oxygen atoms in KClO<sub>3</sub> =Number of moles of oxygen atoms in  O<sub>2</sub>, <br>
or, 3 × No of moles of KClO<sub>3</sub> = 2 × No of moles of O<sub>2</sub> <br>
or, 3 × wt. of KClO<sub>3</sub>/ Mol. wt. of KClO<sub>3</sub> =  2 × wt. of O<sub>2</sub>/ Mol. wt. of O<sub>2</sub><br>
or, 3 × wt. of KClO<sub>3</sub>/122.5 = 2 × wt. of O<sub>2</sub>/32<br>
So, we can easlily calculate the weight of O<sub>2</sub> from the weight of KClO<sub>3</sub> and vice versa.
