<h1>Group 16 Elements</h1>
Oxygen, sulphur, selenium, tellurium and polonium constitute Group
16 of the periodic table. This is sometimes known as group of
chalcogens. The name is derived from the Greek word for brass and
points to the association of sulphur and its congeners with copper.
Most copper minerals contain either oxygen or sulphur and frequently
the other members of the group.<br>

<b>Occurrence</b>:Oxygen is the most abundant of all the elements on earth. Oxygen
forms about 46.6% by mass of earth’s crust. Dry air contains 20.946%
oxygen by volume.<br>
However, the abundance of sulphur in the earth’s crust is only
0.03-0.1%. Combined sulphur exists primarily as sulphates such as
gypsum CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, epsom salt MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, baryte 
BaSO<sub>4</sub> and sulphides such as galena PbS, zinc blende ZnS, copper pyrites CuFeS<sub>2</sub>.
Traces of sulphur occur as hydrogen sulphide in volcanoes. Organic
materials such as eggs, proteins, garlic, onion, mustard, hair and wool
contain sulphur.<br>
Selenium and tellurium are also found as metal selenides and
tellurides in sulphide ores. Polonium occurs in nature as a decay
product of thorium and uranium minerals.<br>
The important atomic and physical properties of Group16 along
with electronic configuration are discussed below.
<p>
    <b>Electronic Configuration:</b>
    The elements of Group16 have six electrons in the outermost shell and
have ns<sup>2</sup>np<sup>4</sup> general electronic configuration.<br>
<b>Atomic and Ionic Radii:</b>
Due to increase in the number of shells, atomic and ionic radii increase
from top to bottom in the group. The size of oxygen atom is, however,
exceptionally small.<br>
<b>Ionisation Enthalpy:</b>
Ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group. It is due to increase in
size. However, the elements of this group have lower ionisation enthalpy
values compared to those of Group15 in the corresponding periods.
This is due to the fact that Group 15 elements have extra stable halffilled
p orbitals electronic configurations.<br>
<b>Electron Gain Enthalpy:</b>
Because of the compact nature of oxygen atom, it has less negative
electron gain enthalpy than sulphur. However, from sulphur onwards
the value again becomes less negative upto polonium.<br>
<b>Electronegativity:</b>
Next to fluorine, oxygen has the highest electronegativity value amongst
the elements. Within the group, electronegativity decreases with an
increase in atomic number. This implies that the metallic character
increases from oxygen to polonium.
</p>

<p>
<b>Physical Properties:</b>
Oxygen and sulphur are non-metals, selenium and tellurium
metalloids, whereas polonium is a metal. Polonium is radioactive and
is short lived (Half-life 13.8 days). All these elements exhibit allotropy.
The melting and boiling points increase with an increase in atomic
number down the group. The large difference between the melting and
boiling points of oxygen and sulphur may be explained on the basis
of their atomicity; oxygen exists as diatomic molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) whereas
sulphur exists as polyatomic molecule (S<sub>8</sub>).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Chemical Properties:</b><br>
    <b>Oxidation states and trends in chemical reactivity:</b><br>
    The elements of Group 16 exhibit a number of oxidation states . 
    The stability of -2 oxidation state decreases down the group.
Polonium hardly shows –2 oxidation state. Since electronegativity of
oxygen is very high, it shows only negative oxidation state as –2 except
in the case of OF<sub>2</sub> where its oxidation state is + 2. Other elements of the
group exhibit + 2, + 4, + 6 oxidation states but + 4 and + 6 are more
common. Sulphur, selenium and tellurium usually show + 4 oxidation
state in their compounds with oxygen and + 6 with fluorine. The stability
of + 6 oxidation state decreases down the group and stability of + 4
oxidation state increases (inert pair effect). Bonding in +4 and +6
oxidation states is primarily covalent.<br>

<b>Anomalous behaviour of oxygen:</b>
The anomalous behaviour of oxygen, like other members of p-block
present in second period is due to its small size and high
electronegativity. One typical example of effects of small size and high
electronegativity is the presence of strong hydrogen bonding in H2O
which is not found in H<sub>2</sub>S.<br>
The absence of d orbitals in oxygen limits its covalency to four and
in practice, rarely exceeds two. On the other hand, in case of other
elements of the group, the valence shells can be expanded and covalence
exceeds four.<br>
<b>(i) Reactivity with hydrogen:</b> All the elements of Group 16 form
hydrides of the type H<sub>2</sub>E (E = O, S, Se, Te, Po). 
Their <em>acidic character</em> increases
from H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>2</sub>Te. The increase in acidic character can be explained
in terms of decrease in bond enthalpy for the dissociation of H–E
bond down the group. Owing to the decrease in enthalpy for the
dissociation of H–E bond down the group, the thermal stability of
hydrides also decreases from H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>2</sub>Po. All the hydrides except
water possess reducing property and this character increases from
H<sub>2</sub>S to H<sub>2</sub>Te.<br>

<b>(ii) Reactivity with oxygen:</b> All these elements form oxides of the EO<sub>2</sub>
and EO<sub>3</sub> types where E = S, Se, Te or Po. Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and sulphur
dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) are gases while selenium dioxide (SeO<sub>2</sub>) is solid.
Reducing property of dioxide decreases from SO<sub>2</sub> to TeO<sub>2</sub>; SO<sub>2</sub> is
reducing while TeO<sub>2</sub> is an oxidising agent. Besides EO<sub>2</sub> type,
sulphur, selenium and tellurium also form EO<sub>3</sub> type oxides (SO<sub>3</sub>,
SeO<sub>3</sub>, TeO<sub>3</sub>). Both types of oxides are acidic in nature.<br>

<b>(iii) Reactivity towards the halogens:</b> Elements of Group 16 form a large
number of halides of the type, EX<sub>6</sub>, EX<sub>4</sub> and EX<sub>2</sub> where E is an
element of the group and X is a halogen. The stability of the halides
decreases in the order F<sup>-</sup> > Cl<sup>-</sup> > Br<sup>-</sup> > I<sup>-</sup>. Amongst hexahalides,
hexafluorides are the only stable halides. All hexafluorides are
gaseous in nature. They have octahedral structure. Sulphur
hexafluoride, SF<sub>6</sub> is exceptionally stable for steric reasons.
Amongst tetrafluorides, SF<sub>4</sub> is a gas, SeF<sub>4</sub> a liquid and TeF<sub>4</sub> a solid.
These fluorides have sp<sup>3</sup>d hybridisation and thus, have trigonal
bipyramidal structures in which one of the equatorial positions is
occupied by a lone pair of electrons. This geometry is also regarded as
see-saw geometry.<br>
All elements except oxygen form dichlorides and dibromides. These
dihalides are formed by sp<sup>3</sup> hybridisation and thus, have tetrahedral
structure. The well known monohalides are dimeric in nature. Examples
are S<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 
S<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>, Se<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and Se<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>. 
These dimeric halides undergo disproportionation as given below:<br>

<p>
    <h3>Dioxygen</h3>
    <b>Preparation:</b><br>
    Dioxygen can be obtained in the laboratory by the following ways:<br>
(i) By heating oxygen containing salts such as chlorates, nitrates and
permanganates.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic2.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
(ii) By the thermal decomposition of the oxides of metals low in the
electrochemical series and higher oxides of some metals.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic3.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
(iii) Hydrogen peroxide is readily decomposed into water and dioxygen
by catalysts such as finely divided metals and manganese dioxide.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic4.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
On large scale it can be prepared from water or air. Electrolysis of
water leads to the release of hydrogen at the cathode and oxygen
at the anode.<br>
Industrially, dioxygen is obtained from air by first removing carbon
dioxide and water vapour and then, the remaining gases are liquefied
and fractionally distilled to give dinitrogen and dioxygen.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Properties:</b><br>
    Dioxygen is a colourless and odourless gas. Its solubility in water is to
the extent of 3.08 cm<sup>3</sup> in 100 cm<sup>3</sup> water at 293 K which is just sufficient
for the vital support of marine and aquatic life. It liquefies at 90 K and
freezes at 55 K. Oxygen atom has three stable isotopes: 16O, 17O and
18O. Molecular oxygen, O<sub>2</sub> is unique in being paramagnetic inspite of
having even number of electrons .<br>
Dioxygen directly reacts with nearly all metals and non-metals
except some metals ( e.g., Au, Pt) and some noble gases. Its combination
with other elements is often strongly exothermic which helps in
sustaining the reaction. However, to initiate the reaction, some external
heating is required as bond dissociation enthalpy of oxgyen-oxygen
double bond is high (493.4 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>).<br>
Some of the reactions of dioxygen with metals, non-metals and
other compounds are given below:<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic5.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Some compounds are catalytically oxidised. For example,<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic6.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
<em>Uses:</em> In addition to its importance in normal respiration and combustion
processes, oxygen is used in oxyacetylene welding, in the manufacture of
many metals, particularly steel. Oxygen cylinders are widely used in hospitals,
high altitude flying and in mountaineering. The combustion of fuels, e.g.,
hydrazines in liquid oxygen, provides tremendous thrust in rockets.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Simple Oxides</b><br>
    A binary compound of oxygen with another element is called oxide. As
already stated, oxygen reacts with most of the elements of the periodic
table to form oxides. In many cases one element forms two or more
oxides. The oxides vary widely in their nature and properties.
Oxides can be simple (e.g., MgO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ) or mixed (Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).
Simple oxides can be classified on the basis of their acidic, basic or
amphoteric character. An oxide that combines with water to give an
acid is termed acidic oxide 
(e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ). 
For example,
SO<sub>2</sub> combines with water to give H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, an acid.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic7.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
As a general rule, only non-metal oxides are acidic but oxides of
some metals in high oxidation state also have acidic character (e.g.,
Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, CrO<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>). 
The oxides which give a base with water are known
as basic oxides (e.g., Na<sub>2</sub>O, CaO, BaO). For example, CaO combines
with water to give Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, a base.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic8.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
In general, metallic oxides are basic.<br>
Some metallic oxides exhibit a dual behaviour. They show
characteristics of both acidic as well as basic oxides. Such oxides are
known as amphoteric oxides. They react with acids as well as alkalies.
For example, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> reacts with acids as well as alkalies.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic9.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
There are some oxides which are neither acidic nor basic. Such oxides
are known as neutral oxides. Examples of neutral oxides are CO, NO
and N<sub>2</sub>O.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Ozone:</b><br>
    Ozone is an allotropic form of oxygen. It is too reactive to remain for
long in the atmosphere at sea level. At a height of about 20 kilometres,
it is formed from atmospheric oxygen in the presence of sunlight. This
ozone layer protects the earth’s surface from an excessive concentration
of ultraviolet (UV) radiations.<br>
<b>Preparation:</b><br>
When a slow dry stream of oxygen is passed through a silent electrical
discharge, conversion of oxygen to ozone (10%) occurs. The product is
known as ozonised oxygen.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic10.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Since the formation of ozone from oxygen is an endothermic process,
it is necessary to use a silent electrical discharge in its preparation to
prevent its decomposition.<br>
If concentrations of ozone greater than 10 per cent are required, a
battery of ozonisers can be used, and pure ozone (b.p. 101.1K) can be
condensed in a vessel surrounded by liquid oxygen.<br>
<b>Properties:</b>
Pure ozone is a pale blue gas, dark blue liquid and violet-black solid.
Ozone has a characteristic smell and in small concentrations it is harmless.
However, if the concentration rises above about 100 parts per million,
breathing becomes uncomfortable resulting in headache and nausea.<br>
Ozone is thermodynamically unstable with respect to oxygen since
its decomposition into oxygen results in the liberation of heat (ΔH is
negative) and an increase in entropy (ΔS is positive). These two effects
reinforce each other, resulting in large negative Gibbs energy change
(ΔG) for its conversion into oxygen. It is not really surprising, therefore,
high concentrations of ozone can be dangerously explosive.<br>
Due to the ease with which it liberates atoms of nascent oxygen
(O<sub>3</sub> → O<sub>2</sub> + O), it acts as a powerful oxidising agent. For example, it
oxidises lead sulphide to lead sulphate and iodide ions to iodine.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic11.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
When ozone reacts with an excess of potassium iodide solution
buffered with a borate buffer (pH 9.2), iodine is liberated which can be
titrated against a standard solution of sodium thiosulphate. This is a
quantitative method for estimating O<sub>3</sub> gas.<br>
Experiments have shown that nitrogen oxides (particularly nitric
oxide) combine very rapidly with ozone and there is, thus, the possibility
that nitrogen oxides emitted from the exhaust systems of supersonic
jet aeroplanes might be slowly depleting the concentration of the ozone
layer in the upper atmosphere.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic12.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Another threat to this ozone layer is probably posed by the use of
freons which are used in aerosol sprays and as refrigerants.

    The two oxygen-oxygen bond lengths in the ozone
    molecule are identical (128 pm) and the molecule is angular
    as expected with a bond angle of about 117<sup>0</sup>. It is a resonance
    hybrid of two main forms:

</div>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Uses:</b>
    It is used as a germicide, disinfectant and for sterilising water. It is also
used for bleaching oils, ivory, flour, starch, etc. It acts as an oxidising agent
in the manufacture of potassium permanganate.

<h3>Sulphur</h3>
<p>
    <b>Allotropic Forms:</b>
    Sulphur forms numerous allotropes of which the yellow rhombic
(α-sulphur) and monoclinic (β -sulphur) forms are the most important.
The stable form at room temperature is rhombic sulphur, which
transforms to monoclinic sulphur when heated above 369 K.<br>
<b>Rhombic sulphur (α-sulphur):</b>
This allotrope is yellow in colour, m.p. 385.8 K and specific gravity
2.06. Rhombic sulphur crystals are formed on evaporating the solution
of roll sulphur in CS<sub>2</sub>. It is insoluble in water but dissolves to some
extent in benzene, alcohol and ether. It is readily soluble in CS<sub>2</sub>.<br>
<b>Monoclinic sulphur (β-sulphur):</b>
Its m.p. is 393 K and specific gravity 1.98. It is soluble in CS<sub>2</sub>. This
form of sulphur is prepared by melting rhombic sulphur in a dish
and cooling, till crust is formed. Two holes are made in the crust and
the remaining liquid poured out. On removing the crust, colourless
needle shaped crystals of β-sulphur are formed. It is stable above 369 K
and transforms into α-sulphur below it. Conversely, α-sulphur is
stable below 369 K and transforms into β-sulphur above this. At 369 K
both the forms are stable. This temperature is called transition
temperature.<br>
Both rhombic and monoclinic sulphur have S<sub>8</sub> molecules. These S<sub>8</sub>
molecules are packed to give different crystal structures. The S<sub>8</sub> ring
in both the forms is puckered and has a crown shape.
<div style="display: inline-flex;">
<div><img src="pic_group16/pic14.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"></div>
<div style="margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 5px;">
    Several other modifications
    of sulphur containing 6-20
    sulphur atoms per ring have
    been synthesised in the last
    two decades. <br>In cyclo-S<sub>6</sub>, the
    ring adopts the chair form and
    the molecular dimensions are
    as shown in Figure.<br>
    At elevated temperatures
    (~1000 K), S<sub>2</sub> is the dominant
    species and is paramagnetic
    like O<sub>2</sub>.
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sulphur Dioxide</b><br>
    <b>Preparation:</b><br>
    Sulphur dioxide is formed together with a little (6-8%) sulphur trioxide
when sulphur is burnt in air or oxygen:<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic15.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
In the laboratory it is readily generated by treating a sulphite with
dilute sulphuric acid.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic16.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Industrially, it is produced as a by-product of the roasting of
sulphide ores.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic17.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
The gas after drying is liquefied under pressure and stored in steel cylinders.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Properties:</b><br>
    Sulphur dioxide is a colourless gas with pungent smell and is highly
soluble in water. It liquefies at room temperature under a pressure of
two atmospheres and boils at 263 K.<br>
Sulphur dioxide, when passed through water, forms a solution of
sulphurous acid.<br>
SO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>(aq)<br>
It reacts readily with sodium hydroxide solution, forming sodium
sulphite, which then reacts with more sulphur dioxide to form sodium
hydrogen sulphite.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic18.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
In its reaction with water and alkalies, the behaviour of sulphur
dioxide is very similar to that of carbon dioxide.<br>
Sulphur dioxide reacts with chlorine in the presence of charcoal (which
acts as a catalyst) to give sulphuryl chloride, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. It is oxidised to
sulphur trioxide by oxygen in the presence of vanadium(V) oxide catalyst.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic19.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
When moist, sulphur dioxide behaves as a reducing agent. For
example, it converts iron(III) ions to iron(II) ions and decolourises
acidified potassium permanganate(VII) solution; the latter reaction is a
convenient test for the gas.

of the two canonical forms:

</div>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Uses:</em>
    Sulphur dioxide is used (i) in refining petroleum and sugar (ii) in bleaching
wool and silk and (iii) as an anti-chlor, disinfectant and preservative. Sulphuric
acid, sodium hydrogen sulphite and calcium hydrogen sulphite (industrial
chemicals) are manufactured from sulphur dioxide. Liquid SO<sub>2</sub> is used as a
solvent to dissolve a number of organic and inorganic chemicals.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Oxoacids of Sulphur:</b>
    Sulphur forms a number of oxoacids such as 
    H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 
    H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 
    H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,
H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 
H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>x</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (x = 2 to 5), 
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 
H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>5</sub>, 
H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> . Some of
these acids are unstable and cannot be isolated. They are known in
aqueous solution or in the form of their salts. Structures of some
important oxoacids are shown in the following Figure.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic22.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sulphuric Acid</b><br>
    <b>Manufacture:</b>
    Sulphuric acid is one of the most important industrial chemicals
worldwide.
Sulphuric acid is manufactured by the Contact Process which involves
three steps:<br>
(i) burning of sulphur or sulphide ores in air to generate SO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
(ii) conversion of SO<sub>2</sub> to SO<sub>3</sub> by the reaction with oxygen in the presence
of a catalyst (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and <br>
(iii) absorption of SO<sub>3</sub> in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to give Oleum 
(H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>).<br>
The SO<sub>2</sub> produced is purified by removing dust and other
impurities such as arsenic compounds.<br>
The key step in the manufacture of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is the catalytic oxidation
of SO<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>2</sub> to give SO<sub>3</sub> in the presence of 
V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (catalyst).<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic23.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
The reaction is exothermic, reversible and the forward reaction leads
to a decrease in volume. Therefore, low temperature and high pressure
are the favourable conditions for maximum yield. But the temperature
should not be very low otherwise rate of reaction will become slow.<br>
In practice, the plant is operated at a pressure of 2 bar and a
temperature of 720 K. The SO<sub>3</sub> gas from the catalytic converter is
absorbed in concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to produce oleum. Dilution of oleum
with water gives H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> of the desired concentration. In the industry
two steps are carried out simultaneously to make the process a
continuous one and also to reduce the cost.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic24.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
The sulphuric acid obtained by Contact process is 96-98% pure.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Properties:</b><br>
    Sulphuric acid is a colourless, dense, oily liquid with a specific gravity
of 1.84 at 298 K. The acid freezes at 283 K and boils at 611 K. It
dissolves in water with the evolution of a large quantity of heat. Hence,
care must be taken while preparing sulphuric acid solution from
concentrated sulphuric acid. The concentrated acid must be added
slowly into water with constant stirring.<br>
The chemical reactions of sulphuric acid are as a result of the
following characteristics: <br>(a) low volatility<br> (b) strong acidic character<br>
(c) strong affinity for water and<br> (d) ability to act as an oxidising agent.<br>
In aqueous solution, sulphuric acid ionises in two steps.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic25.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
The larger value of  K<sub>a1</sub> (K<sub>a1</sub> >10) means that H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is largely
dissociated into H<sup>+</sup> and HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. Greater the value of dissociation constant
(K<sub>a</sub>), the stronger is the acid.<br>
The acid forms two series of salts: normal sulphates (such as sodium
sulphate and copper sulphate) and acid sulphates (e.g., sodium
hydrogen sulphate).<br>
Sulphuric acid, because of its low volatility can be used to
manufacture more volatile acids from their corresponding salts.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic26.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Concentrated sulphuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent. Many
wet gases can be dried by passing them through sulphuric acid,
provided the gases do not react with the acid. Sulphuric acid removes
water from organic compounds; it is evident by its charring action on
carbohydrates.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic27.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Hot concentrated sulphuric acid is a moderately strong oxidising
agent. In this respect, it is intermediate between phosphoric and nitric
acids. Both metals and non-metals are oxidised by concentrated
sulphuric acid, which is reduced to SO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
<img src="pic_group16/pic28.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
<br>
<em>Uses:</em><br>
Sulphuric acid is a very important industrial chemical. A nation’s
industrial strength can be judged by the quantity of sulphuric acid it
produces and consumes. It is needed for the manufacture of hundreds
of other compounds and also in many industrial processes. The bulk
of sulphuric acid produced is used in the manufacture of fertilisers
(e.g., ammonium sulphate, superphosphate). Other uses are in:
(a) petroleum refining (b) manufacture of pigments, paints and dyestuff
intermediates (c) detergent industry (d) metallurgical applications (e.g.,
cleansing metals before enameling, electroplating and galvanising
(e) storage batteries (f) in the manufacture of nitrocellulose products
and (g) as a laboratory reagent.
