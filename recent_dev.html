	<h3>Weight of the neutrino:</h3>A neutrino
	is a fermion (an elementary particle with spin of 1/2
 that interacts only via the weak interaction and gravity. 
Its rest mass is so small that it was long thought to be zero. 
The rest mass of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the other
known elementary particles excluding massless particles. The weak force has a very short range,
the gravitational interaction is extremely weak due to the very small mass of the neutrino,
and neutrinos do not participate in the strong interaction.Weak interactions create neutrinos 
in one of three leptonic flavors:Electron neutrino,muon neutrino and tau neutrino.
Although neutrinos were long believed to be massless, it is now known that there are
three discrete neutrino masses with different tiny values(the smallest of which could even be zero), 
but the three masses do not uniquely correspond to the three flavors.The three mass values 
are not yet known as of 2022, but laboratory experiments and cosmological observations have determined the differences of their squares,
an upper limit on their sum (< 2.14×10<sup>−37</sup> kg),
and an upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino.

<li><h3>Carbon sink </h3>
A carbon sink is anything that absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases – for example
, plants, the ocean and soil. In contrast, a carbon source is anything that releases more carbon into
 the atmosphere than it absorbs – for example, the burning of fossil fuels or volcanic eruptions.
 Mass-produced plastics can be found virtually everywhere today. One of the well-known products are 
 plastic bottles, which can consist of several different materials, and their recycling is not the 
 easiest. Although the recovery of plastic is associated with costs and it is a complicated process,
 which makes it still not very popular, scientists are looking for applications for the material
 recovered that could make this process even more beneficial.<br>

A group of chemists from Rice University have announced the results of their research, 
which prove that used plastic can be helpful in the fight against high carbon dioxide emissions.
 As reported in the “ASC Nano”, journal, scientists have explored the process of pyrolysis,
 which is the breakdown of chemicals. It consists in heating particular substances to very
 high temperatures, maintaining anaerobic conditions. Currently, pyrolysis is used in the 
 petrochemical industry, among others.</li>
 
<li><h3> Quantum Nanomagnet </h3>
A quantum nanomagnet with unique properties is a discovery of scientists from the 
Jagiellonian University. A team of researchers led by Dr Dawid Pinkowicz, described 
in the “Nature Communications”, journal a new type of organometallic quantum nanomagnet,
 in which the central magnetic ion is surrounded only by other metal ions. The molecule 
 consists of a central erbium ion, which combines with three heavy rhenium ions. 
 This combination made it possible to get closer to the properties of the already known large macroscopic magnets.

Scientists emphasize that although molecular magnets will not be used in the near future,
 they can revolutionize the future and change such fields as electronics and computer science.
 Currently known molecular magnets require strong cooling; therefore, to find practical
 application for nanomagnets it is necessary to create them in such a way that they can
 operate at room temperature. Scientists await further research in this area.

<h3>Sodium batteries </h3>
Lithium-ion batteries are used in most everyday devices. The production of such devices require rare metals 
such as cobalt and lithium, which is also not a common element and has a significant impact on the production price.
According to the scientists, lithium could be replaced by sodium, which would significantly reduce production costs. 
In addition, sodium batteries would charge much faster and depleting the battery “to zero” would not have a harmful effect.
 However, the work carried out so far has ended in a fiasco, because sodium very quickly forms thin, metallic structures 
 on the electrode – the so-called dendrites, which resulted in the short life of such batteries.<br>

Researchers from the University of Texas in Austin solved this problem by using a computer model to create a new material
 that prevents the formation of dendrites and, as a result, it prevents damage to the electrode. It was made by depositing 
 a thin layer of sodium on antimony telluride and folding it many times, thus creating alternating layers. Thanks to this,
 sodium is very evenly distributed and dendrites form much slower and less frequently on it. This allows to create a sodium
 battery that will match the lithium one in terms of the number of charge and discharge cycles, and will also have a 
 comparable energy density. Sodium batteries may become the future for the industry.

<h3> Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2022  </h3>
This year, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to three people. Carolyn R. Bertozzi,
 Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless are the winners of the Prize, who were recognized “for the development of click 
 chemistry technology and bioorthogonal chemistry”.<br>

The <em>“click chemistry”</em> is a process that can be compared to a building made of LEGO bricks. Namely, specific fragments 
of molecules can be combined with each other to produce compounds of high complexity and diversity. The combination of 
simple elements, which we can call “chemical building blocks”, allows you to create an almost infinite variety of molecules.
 Bioorthogonal chemistry, on the other hand, allows to monitor the chemical processes that take place in living cells without 
 damaging them. This offers a unique opportunity to study diseases inside cells as well as in complex organisms.<br>

Both the “click chemistry” technology and bioorthogonal chemistry are important discoveries, mainly for medicine and pharmacy,
 which can significantly affect the development of both these fields.

<h3>Discovery of new minerals   </h3>
El Ali, also known as Nightfall  Is a 15.2-tonne meteorite that was first identified in Somalia in 2020. 
After two years of studying the 70-gram sample, scientists from the Canadian University of Alberta in 
Egmont discovered two minerals in it that had not been seen on Earth before.<br>

The discovered minerals were named elalite (in honor of the meteorite and the town near which it was discovered)
 and elchistantonite (after NASA researcher Linda Elkins-Tanton). The researchers announced the discovery of new 
 chemical compounds on November 21, during the Space Exploration Symposium held at the University of Alberta. 
 It is worth noting that although minerals have not been seen in their natural form on our planet, very similar
 ones were created synthetically in laboratories in the 1980s. Research on the new compounds will help answer
 the question of what applications these minerals can find in our world in the future.

<h3> Breakthrough in thermonuclear fusion research  </h3>
December 5, 2022 became an important day for the world of science, but also for the history of mankind.
 On this day, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) scientists achieved a breakthrough in 
 thermonuclear fusion research, which has been conducted at the National Ignition Facility (NIF).
 For the first time in history, fusion has produced more energy than was expended to start the reaction.
 The news of this event was announced on December 13 during a press conference of the LLNL representatives, 
 which was held in the presence of the secretary of the Department of Energy and the head of the US nuclear
 safety agency.<br>

Thermonuclear fusion consists in combining light atomic nuclei into heavier ones, which is accompanied
 by the release of significant amounts of energy. The fuel that would be ideally suited to generate energy 
 as a result of this reaction is hydrogen, because we have it in abundance on our planet. However, atomic
 nuclei repel electrostatic forces, so for the fusion to occur, very specific conditions must be created,
 namely heating them to millions of degrees and squeezing them to millions of atmospheres (this process
 is different in stars, where it takes place thanks to quantum tunneling).<br>

Thermonuclear fusion has been attempted many times around the world, but so far the result has been 
the absorption of more energy than the amount produced. The National Ignition Facility has been working
 on this phenomenon since the 1950s, but it is technically very difficult. That is why the latest results
 are such a huge breakthrough and show new possibilities.

<h3>  Ultra-thin solar cells </h3>
Much is said about the fact that renewable energy sources are the future of our planet, which can significantly
 affect the containment of the climate crisis and global warming. That is why scientists are still looking for 
 solutions that will help to use energy from RES even better and easier.<br>

Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created innovative solar cells that can turn any 
solid surface into a source of energy, and are thinner than a human hair. These cells are glued to a light and 
very strong fabric, which allows to easily mount them virtually anywhere. According to the scientists, the 
invention can be very practical in emergencies, when there is no other source of energy in the area, but also
 when travelling.<br>

The modern cell was made of semiconductor ink with the help of a 3D printer. It is one hundred times lighter 
than conventional panels, and additionally generates much more energy per kilogram. The solution is still in the
 testing phase, because there are problems related to the resistance of the panels to environmental factors. 
 However, scientists are working on creating ultra-light containers in which the cells could be enclosed. 
 Researchers believe that ultra-thin cells will be a revolutionary invention for energy generation in the world

<h3> The strongest material for Earth  </h3>
Researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducted
research on a new metal alloy that revealed its unusually high ductility (it is malleable and very ductile) and 
at the same time unprecedented strength (resistant to deformation). This alloy consists of chromium, 
cobalt and nickel – CrCoNi.<br>

Based on the first tests performed on CrCoNi, it was found that its ductility and strength improve with the cooling 
of the alloy, even to a temperature of about -196<sup>o</sup>C. However, the latest research, published in December 2022 in the
journal Science confirmed that it is able to withstand even lower temperatures (-253<sup>o</sup>C) where liquid helium is present. 
This is a very interesting phenomenon, because for most other materials the effect is opposite; for example, 
steel cracks much easier at very low temperatures.<br>

It is worth noting that the CrCoNi alloy belongs to the group of HEA alloys (high entropy alloys).
They are distinguished by the fact that they are a mixture of constituent elements in equal parts,
rather than with a predominance of one element and a smaller amount of additional elements, 
as it is the case for most currently used alloys. This has a significant impact on its extraordinary properties.<br>
 
The unique strength of the CrCoNi alloy at incredibly low temperatures may make it applicable in the future, among others,
in objects traversing space
