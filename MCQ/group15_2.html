	1. The correct statement with respect to dinitrogen is:
(a) N₂ is paramagnetic in nature.	
(b) it can combine with dioxygen at 25 °C.
(c) liquid dinitrogen is not used in cryosurgery.
(d) it can be used as an inert diluent for reactive chemicals.
Ans. (d)
Explanation : This is correct. Dinitrogen is a very stable molecule due to the strong triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms. 
This makes it largely unreactive at room temperature and pressure. As a result, it is commonly used to provide an inert atmosphere 
to prevent unwanted reactions, such as the oxidation of sensitive chemicals.

Explanation: The reaction in question is:
 
Phosphorus trioxide (P₄O6) forms when white phosphorus is burned in a limited supply of oxygen.If oxygen is too abundant, 
	 it produces P₄O10 instead. Now, for selective formation of P₄O6, we need to dilute oxygen so that it’s in limited supply.
	 That’s exactly what happens when oxygen is mixed with nitrogen — nitrogen acts as an inert diluent.

	 in the tetrahedral structure).The bonding in P₄ involves sp³ hybrid orbitals.
	In sp³ hybridization:
	1 part s orbital
	3 parts p orbitals
So, the total p-character = 3/4×100=75%

37. Amongst the trihalides of nitrogen which one is least basic?
(a) NF3		(b) NCI3		(c) NBr3		(d) NI3
Ans. (a)
Explanation: The basicity of nitrogen trihalides decreases as the electronegativity of the halogen increases, 
because a more electronegative halogen pulls electron density away from nitrogen, reducing the availability of the lone pair for donation.
Electronegativity order of halogens: F > Cl > Br > I
So, NF₃ has the least available lone pair for donation → least basic.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
38. Which of the following oxides of nitrogen is a coloured gas?
 (a) N₂O		(b) NO		(c) N2O5		(d) NO2
Ans. (d)
Explanation: NO2 is a molecule with an unpaired electron, making it a free radical. This unpaired electron is the key factor. 
	When visible light interacts with NO2, the unpaired electron can easily get excited and move to a higher energy level. 
	This process absorbs specific wavelengths of light from the visible spectrum, and the unabsorbed wavelengths are 
	transmitted or reflected, which our eyes perceive as a reddish-brown color.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….

…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
42. In the elemental state, which of the following elements from group 15 forms metallic bonds?
(a) As		(b) P		(c) Sb		(d) Bi
Ans. (d)
Explanation: In group 15, the heavier elements like Sb and Bi show metallic character in the elemental state because of their 
	larger atomic size and delocalized electrons. Among the given options, Bi is the most metallic and forms metallic bonds in 
	its elemental state.

(a) It can act as only reducing agent		
(b) It can act as only oxidising agent
(c) It can act both as oxidant and reductant	
(d) It is stable only in aqueous solution.
Ans. (c)
Explanation: For HNO₂ (nitrous acid):
Nitrogen is in the +3 oxidation state.
It can be oxidized to +5 (HNO₃) → acts as a reducing agent.
It can be reduced to +2 or lower (NO, N₂, NH₃) → acts as an oxidizing agent.
So, it can act both as oxidant and reductant → amphoteric redox behaviour.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
45. Of the following which is paramagnetic and has three electron bond in its structure
(a) N2O	(b) NO	(c) N2O3	(d) N2O5
Ans. (b)
Explanation: 
•  NO has 11 valence electrons → odd number of electrons → one unpaired electron.
•  The bond order in NO comes from molecular orbital theory and involves a three-electron bond (one σ bond, one π bond, 
	and one π* with one unpaired electron).
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
46. With respect to protonic acids, which of the following statements is correct?
(a) PH3 more basic than NH3		(b) PH3 less basic than NH3
(c) PH3 equally basic as NH3		(d) PH3 amphoteric while NH3 basic.

Ans. (b)
Explanation:Basicity here refers to the tendency of the molecule to donate its lone pair to a proton (H⁺).NH₃ has a smaller 
	nitrogen atom with a more concentrated lone pair, making it more available for bonding with a proton.PH₃ has a larger 
	phosphorus atom; its lone pair is in a more diffuse 3p orbital and is held less tightly, so it is less available for 
	protonation.Hence, NH₃ is more basic, and PH₃ is less basic toward protonic acids.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
47. If you touch concentrated HNO3 with your finger and immediately wash it with water, then the skin at the place where it 
	came into contact with HNO3 becomes yellow. This is because of:
(a) the formation of Xanthoprotein
(b) the absorption of HNO3 by skin
(c) the blood absorbing HNO3,
(d) the absorption of yellow/brown NO2 gas
Ans. (a)
Explanation: Concentrated nitric acid reacts with proteins in the skin (which contain aromatic amino acids like tyrosine, 
	tryptophan, and phenylalanine).
This reaction is called the xanthoproteic reaction — it introduces a nitro group into the aromatic ring, producing yellow 
	nitro-derivatives.
Even if you wash immediately, the nitration is almost instantaneous, so the yellow stain appears.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
48. PCl5 is possible but NCI5 does not exist
(a) in N, d-sub-shell is absent
(b) ionization energy of N is very high
(c) it does not like Cl
(d) none of these

Ans. (a)
Explanation:  PCl₅ formation requires phosphorus to expand its octet to 10 electrons, which it does using vacant 3d orbitals.
Nitrogen is in period 2 and has only 2s and 2p orbitals — no available d-sub-shell — so it cannot expand its octet beyond 8 electrons.
Therefore, NCl₅ cannot exist, while PCl₅ is stable.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
49. The boiling points of the following hydrides follow the order of
(a) SbH3>NH3 > AsH3 > PH3	(b) NH3> AsH3> PH3> SbH3
(c) SbH3>AsH3 > PH3 > NH3	(d) NH3> PH3> AsH3> SbH3
Ans. (a)
Explanation:  Two main factors decide boiling point trends in group 15 hydrides:
Molecular mass effect – Heavier molecules generally have higher boiling points due to stronger van der Waals forces.
This effect gives the order: SbH₃ > AsH₃ > PH₃ > NH₃.
Hydrogen bonding – NH₃ can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which raise its boiling point above what its 
	molecular mass would suggest.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
50. Which of the following statements is not correct for nitrogen?
(a) Its electronegativity is very high
(b) d-orbitals are available for bonding
(c) It is a typical non-metal
(d) Its molecular size is small
Ans. (b)
Explanation:  Nitrogen is in period 2, so its valence shell has only 2s and 2p orbitals — no 2d orbitals exist.Therefore, 
	it cannot expand its octet or use d-orbitals for bonding.
