<h1>Group 15 Elements</h1>
Group 15 includes nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony and
bismuth. As we go down the group, there is a shift from non-metallic
to metallic through metalloidic character. Nitrogen and phosphorus
are non-metals, arsenic and antimony metalloids and bismuth is a
typical metal.
<p>
    <b>Occurrence:</b>
    Molecular nitrogen comprises 78% by volume of the atmosphere.
In the earth’s crust, it occurs as sodium nitrate, NaNO<sub>3</sub> (called Chile
saltpetre) and potassium nitrate (Indian saltpetre). It is found in the
form of proteins in plants and animals. Phosphorus occurs in minerals
of the apatite family, Ca<sub>9</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>. CaX<sub>2</sub> (X = F, Cl or OH) (e.g., fluorapatite
Ca<sub>9</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>. CaF<sub>2</sub>>) which are the main components of phosphate rocks.
Phosphorus is an essential constituent of animal and plant matter. It
is present in bones as well as in living cells. Phosphoproteins are present
in milk and eggs. Arsenic, antimony and bismuth are found mainly as
sulphide minerals.Trends of some of the atomic, physical and chemical properties of the
group are discussed below.<br>
<b>Electronic Configuration:</b>
The valence shell electronic configuration of these elements is ns<sup>2</sup>np<sup>3</sup>.
The s orbital in these elements is completely filled and p orbitals are
half-filled, making their electronic configuration extra stable.<br>
<b>Atomic and Ionic Radii:</b>
Covalent and ionic (in a particular state) radii increase in size
down the group. There is a considerable increase in covalent radius
from N to P. However, from As to Bi only a small increase in
covalent radius is observed. This is due to the presence of
completely filled d and/or f orbitals in heavier members.<br>
<b>Ionisation Enthalpy:</b>
Ionisation enthalpy decreases down the group due to gradual increase
in atomic size. Because of the extra stable half-filled p orbitals electronic
configuration and smaller size, the ionisation enthalpy of the group 15
elements is much greater than that of group 14 elements in the
corresponding periods. The order of successive ionisation enthalpies,
as expected is ΔH<sub>1</sub> < ΔH<sub>2</sub> < ΔH<sub>3</sub><br>
<b>Electronegativity:</b>
The electronegativity value, in general, decreases down the group with
increasing atomic size. However, amongst the heavier elements, the
difference is not that much pronounced.<br>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Physical Properties:</b>
        All the elements of this group are polyatomic. Dinitrogen is a diatomic gas
while all others are solids. Metallic character increases down the group.
Nitrogen and phosphorus are non-metals, arsenic and antimony metalloids
and bismuth is a metal. This is due to decrease in ionisation enthalpy and
increase in atomic size. The boiling points, in general, increase from top to
bottom in the group but the melting point increases upto arsenic and then
decreases upto bismuth. Except nitrogen, all the elements show allotropy.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Chemical Properties:</b>
    <em>Oxidation states and trends in chemical reactivity:</em><br>
The common oxidation states of these elements are –3, +3 and +5.
The tendency to exhibit –3 oxidation state decreases down the group due
to increase in size and metallic character. In fact last member of the group,
bismuth hardly forms any compound in –3 oxidation state. The stability
of +5 oxidation state decreases down the group. The only well characterised
Bi (V) compound is BiF<sub>5</sub>. The stability of +5 oxidation state decreases and
that of +3 state increases (due to inert pair effect) down the group. Nitrogen
exhibits + 1, + 2, + 4 oxidation states also when it reacts with oxygen.
Phosphorus also shows +1 and +4 oxidation states in some oxoacids.<br>
In the case of nitrogen, all oxidation states from +1 to +4 tend to
disproportionate in acid solution. For example,<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic1.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Similarly, in case of phosphorus nearly all intermediate oxidation
states disproportionate into +5 and –3 both in alkali and acid. However
+3 oxidation state in case of arsenic, antimony and bismuth becomes
increasingly stable with respect to disproportionation.<br>
Nitrogen is restricted to a maximum covalency of 4 since only four
(one s and three p) orbitals are available for bonding. The heavier elements
have vacant d orbitals in the outermost shell which can be used for
bonding (covalency) and hence, expand their covalence as in PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup>.<br>
<em>Anomalous properties of nitrogen:</em><br>
Nitrogen differs from the rest of the members of this group due to
its small size, high electronegativity, high ionisation enthalpy and
non-availability of d orbitals. Nitrogen has unique ability to form
pπ -pπ multiple bonds with itself and with other elements having
small size and high electronegativity (e.g., C, O). Heavier elements of
this group do not form pπ -pπ bonds as their atomic orbitals are so
large and diffuse that they cannot have effective overlapping.
Thus, nitrogen exists as a diatomic molecule with a triple bond (one
s and two p) between the two atoms. Consequently, its bond enthalpy
(941.4 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>) is very high. On the contrary, phosphorus, arsenic
and antimony form single bonds as P–P, As–As and Sb–Sb while
bismuth forms metallic bonds in elemental state. However, the single
N–N bond is weaker than the single P–P bond because of high
interelectronic repulsion of the non-bonding electrons, owing to the
small bond length. As a result the catenation tendency is weaker in
nitrogen. Another factor which affects the chemistry of nitrogen is
the absence of d orbitals in its valence shell. Besides restricting its
covalency to four, nitrogen cannot form dπ –pπ bond as the heavier
elements can e.g., <br> R<sub>3</sub>P = O or R<sub>3</sub>P = CH<sub>2</sub> (R = alkyl group).
Phosphorus and arsenic can form dπ –dπ bond also with transition metals when
their compounds like P(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and 
As(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> act as ligands.<br>
<b>(i) Reactivity towards hydrogen:</b>
All the elements of Group 15
form hydrides of the type EH<sub>3</sub> where E = N, P, As, Sb or Bi.
The hydrides show regular gradation in their properties.
The stability of hydrides decreases from NH<sub>3</sub> to BiH<sub>3</sub> which can
be observed from their bond dissociation enthalpy.
Consequently, the reducing character of the hydrides increases.
Ammonia is only a mild reducing agent while BiH<sub>3</sub> is the
strongest reducing agent amongst all the hydrides. Basicity also
decreases in the order 
NH<sub>3</sub> > PH<sub>3</sub> > AsH<sub>3</sub> > SbH<sub>3</sub> > BiH<sub>3</sub>.<br>
<b>(ii)Reactivity towards oxygen:</b>
All these elements form two types
of oxides: E<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. 
The oxide in the higher oxidation state
of the element is more acidic than that of lower oxidation state.
Their acidic character decreases down the group. The oxides of
the type E<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> of nitrogen and phosphorus are purely acidic,
that of arsenic and antimony amphoteric and those of bismuth
predominantly basic.<br>
<b>(iii) Reactivity towards halogens:</b>
These elements react to form two
series of halides: EX<sub>3</sub> and EX<sub>5</sub>. Nitrogen does not form
pentahalide due to non-availability of the d orbitals in its valence
shell. Pentahalides are more covalent than trihalides. All the
trihalides of these elements except those of nitrogen are stable.
In case of nitrogen, only NF<sub>3</sub> is known to be stable. Trihalides
except BiF<sub>3</sub> are predominantly covalent in nature.<br>
<b>(iv) Reactivity towards metals:</b>
All these elements react with metals
to form their binary compounds exhibiting –3 oxidation state,
such as, Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> (calcium nitride) Ca<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub> (calcium phosphide),
Na<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub> (sodium arsenide), Zn<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub> (zinc antimonide) and 
Mg<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub> (magnesium bismuthide).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Dinitrogen</b><br>
    <b>Preparation:</b><br>
    Dinitrogen is produced commercially by the liquefaction and fractional
distillation of air. Liquid dinitrogen (b.p. 77.2 K) distils out first leaving
behind liquid oxygen (b.p. 90 K).<br>
In the laboratory, dinitrogen is prepared by treating an aqueous
solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic2.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Small amounts of NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction;
these impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous
sulphuric acid containing potassium dichromate. It can also be obtained
by the thermal decomposition of ammonium dichromate.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic3.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
Very pure nitrogen can be obtained by the thermal decomposition
of sodium or barium azide.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic4.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Properties</b><br>
    Dinitrogen is a colourless, odourless, tasteless and non-toxic gas.
Nitrogen atom has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N. It has a very low
solubility in water (23.2 cm<sup>3</sup> per litre of water at 273 K and 1 bar
pressure) and low freezing and boiling points .
Dinitrogen is rather inert at room temperature because of the high
bond enthalpy of N≡N bond. Reactivity, however, increases rapidly with
rise in temperature. At higher temperatures, it directly combines with
some metals to form predominantly ionic nitrides and with non-metals,
covalent nitrides. A few typical reactions are:<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic5.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
It combines with hydrogen at about 773 K in the presence of a
catalyst (Haber’s Process) to form ammonia:<br>
N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) →  2NH<sub>3</sub>(g); Δ<sub>f</sub>H<sup>0</sup>= –46.1 kJmol<sup>-1</sup><br>
Dinitrogen combines with dioxygen only at very high temperature
(at about 2000 K) to form nitric oxide, NO.<br>
N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2NO(g)<br>
<b>Uses:</b> The main use of dinitrogen is in the manufacture of ammonia and other
industrial chemicals containing nitrogen, (e.g., calcium cyanamide). It also
finds use where an inert atmosphere is required (e.g., in iron and steel industry,
inert diluent for reactive chemicals). Liquid dinitrogen is used as a refrigerant
to preserve biological materials, food items and in cryosurgery.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Ammonia</b><br>
    <b>Preparation:</b><br>
    Ammonia is present in small quantities in air and soil where it is
formed by the decay of nitrogenous organic matter e.g., urea.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic6.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
On a small scale ammonia is obtained from ammonium salts which
decompose when treated with caustic soda or calcium hydroxide.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic7.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
On a large scale, ammonia is manufactured by Haber’s process.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic8.png" style="height: auto; width: auto;"><br>
In accordance with Le Chatelier’s principle, high pressure would
favour the formation of ammonia. The optimum conditions for the
production of ammonia are a pressure of 200 × 10<sup>5</sup> Pa (about 200
atm), a temperature of ~ 700 K and the use of a catalyst such as iron
oxide with small amounts of K<sub>2</sub>O and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to increase the rate of
attainment of equilibrium. Earlier, iron was used as a catalyst with
molybdenum as a promoter.<br><br>

    <img src="pic_pblock/pic9.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; align-self: center;"> 
   </div>  
   <div>
Ammonia is a colourless gas with a pungent odour. Its freezing and
boiling points are 198.4 and 239.7 K respectively.<br>
In the solid and liquid states, it is associated through hydrogen bonds as in the case
of water and that accounts for its higher melting and boiling points
than expected on the basis of its molecular mass. <br>
The ammonia molecule is trigonal pyramidal with the nitrogen atom at the apex. It has three
bond pairs and one lone pair of electrons as shown in the structure.
</div>
</div>
Ammonia gas is highly soluble in water. Its aqueous solution is
weakly basic due to the formation of OH<sup>-</sup> ions.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic10.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
It forms ammonium salts with acids, e.g., NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
, etc. As a weak base, it precipitates the hydroxides (hydrated oxides in case of
some metals) of many metals from their salt solutions. For example,<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic11.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
The presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of
the ammonia molecule makes it a Lewis base. It donates the electron
pair and forms linkage with metal ions and the formation of such
complex compounds finds applications in detection of metal ions
such as Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>:<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic12.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br><br>
<em>Uses:</em>
Ammonia is used to produce various nitrogenous fertilisers
(ammonium nitrate, urea, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulphate)
and in the manufacture of some inorganic nitrogen compounds, the most
important one being nitric acid. Liquid ammonia is also used as a refrigerant.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Oxides of Nitrogen</b><br>
    Nitrogen forms a number of oxides in different oxidation states. The
names, formulas, preparation and physical appearance of these oxides
are given in Table below:<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic13.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br><br>
Lewis dot main resonance structures and bond parameters of oxides
are given in Table below:<br>

</p>
<p>
    <b>Nitric Acid</b><br>
    Nitrogen forms oxoacids such as H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (hyponitrous acid), 
    HNO<sub>2</sub> (nitrous acid) and HNO<sub>3</sub> (nitric acid). Amongst them HNO3 is the
    most important.<br>
    <b>Preparation:</b><br>
    In the laboratory, nitric acid is prepared by heating KNO<sub>3</sub> or NaNO<sub>3</sub>
and concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in a glass retort.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic15.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
On a large scale it is prepared mainly by Ostwald’s process.
This method is based upon catalytic oxidation of NH<sub>3</sub> by atmospheric
oxygen.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic16.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
Nitric oxide thus formed combines with oxygen giving NO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic17.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
Nitrogen dioxide so formed, dissolves in water to give HNO<sub>3</sub>.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic18.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
NO thus formed is recycled and the aqueous HNO<sub>3</sub> can be
concentrated by distillation upto ~ 68% by mass. Further
concentration to 98% can be achieved by dehydration with
concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
</p>
<b>Properties</b><br>
    <div style="display: inline-flex;">
    <div>
        <img src="pic_pblock/pic19.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> 
    </div>
    <div>
        It is a colourless liquid (f.p. 231.4 K and b.p. 355.6 K). Laboratory
        grade nitric acid contains ~ 68% of the HNO<sub>3</sub> by mass and has a
        specific gravity of 1.504.<br>
        In the gaseous state, HNO<sub>3</sub> exists as a planar molecule
        with the structure as shown.
    </div>
    </div>
    In aqueous solution, nitric acid behaves as a strong acid giving
    hydronium and nitrate ions.<br>
    <img src="pic_pblock/pic20.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
    Concentrated nitric acid is a strong oxidising agent and attacks
most metals except noble metals such as gold and platinum. The
products of oxidation depend upon the concentration of the acid,
temperature and the nature of the material undergoing oxidation.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic21.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
Zinc reacts with dilute nitric acid to give N<sub>2</sub>O and with concentrated
acid to give NO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic22.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
Some metals (e.g., Cr, Al) do not dissolve in concentrated nitric
acid because of the formation of a passive film of oxide on the surface.<br>
Concentrated nitric acid also oxidises non–metals and their
compounds. Iodine is oxidised to iodic acid, carbon to carbon dioxide,
sulphur to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and phosphorus to phosphoric acid.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic23.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
Brown Ring Test: The familiar brown ring test for nitrates depends
on the ability of Fe2+ to reduce nitrates to nitric oxide, which reacts
with Fe2+ to form a brown coloured complex. The test is usually carried
out by adding dilute ferrous sulphate solution to an aqueous solution
containing nitrate ion, and then carefully adding concentrated sulphuric
acid along the sides of the test tube. A brown ring at the interface
between the solution and sulphuric acid layers indicates the presence
of nitrate ion in solution.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic24.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
<br>
<em>Uses:</em> The major use of nitric acid is in the manufacture of ammonium nitrate
for fertilisers and other nitrates for use in explosives and pyrotechnics. It is
also used for the preparation of nitroglycerin, trinitrotoluene and other organic
nitro compounds. Other major uses are in the pickling of stainless steel,
etching of metals and as an oxidiser in rocket fuels.<br>
<hr style="border-style:dashed;">
<p>
    <b>Phosphorus</b><br>
    <em>Allotropic Forms:</em>
    Phosphorus is found in many allotropic forms, the important ones
being white, red and black.<br>
<div style="display: inline-flex;">
    <div>

    </div>
    <div>
<em>White phosphorus</em> is a translucent white waxy solid. It is poisonous,
insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulphide and glows in dark
(chemiluminescence). It dissolves in boiling NaOH solution in an inert
atmosphere giving PH<sub>3</sub>.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic25.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
White phosphorus is less stable and therefore, more reactive than
the other solid phases under normal conditions because of angular
strain in the P4 molecule where the angles are only 60°. It readily
catches fire in air to give dense white fumes of P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic26.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
It consists of discrete tetrahedral P<sub>4</sub> molecule as shown in figure.
</div>
</div>

        <img src="pic_pblock/pic27.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
    </div>
    <div>
<em>Red phosphorus</em> is obtained by heating white phosphorus at 573K
in an inert atmosphere for several days. When red phosphorus is heated
under high pressure, a series of phases of black phosphorus is formed.
Red phosphorus possesses iron grey lustre. It is odourless, nonpoisonous
and insoluble in water as well as in carbon disulphide.<br>
Chemically, red phosphorus is much less reactive than white
phosphorus. It does not glow in the dark.
It is polymeric, consisting of chains of P<sub>4</sub>
tetrahedra linked together
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Black phosphorus</em> has two forms α-black
phosphorus and β-black phosphorus. α-Black
phosphorus is formed when red phosphorus is
heated in a sealed tube at 803K. It can be sublimed
in air and has opaque monoclinic or rhombohedral
crystals. It does not oxidise in air. β-Black phosphorus is prepared by
heating white phosphorus at 473 K under high pressure. It does not
burn in air upto 673 K.
</p>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Phosphine</b><br>
    <b>Preparation:</b>
    Phosphine is prepared by the reaction of calcium phosphide with water
or dilute HCl.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic28.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
In the laboratory, it is prepared by heating white phosphorus with
concentrated NaOH solution in an inert atmosphere of CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic29.png" style="height: auto; width: auto; "> <br>
When pure, it is non inflammable but becomes inflammable owing
to the presence of P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> or P<sub>4</sub> vapours. 
To purify it from the impurities,
it is absorbed in HI to form phosphonium iodide (PH<sub>4</sub>I) which on treating
with KOH gives off phosphine.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic30.png" style="height:25px; width:300px; "> <br>
<br>
<b>Properties:</b><br>
It is a colourless gas with rotten fish smell and is highly poisonous.
It explodes in contact with traces of oxidising agents like HNO<sub>3</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub> and
Br<sub>2</sub> vapours.<br>
It is slightly soluble in water. The solution of PH<sub>3</sub> in water decomposes
in presence of light giving red phosphorus and H<sub>2</sub>. When absorbed in
copper sulphate or mercuric chloride solution, the corresponding
phosphides are obtained.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic31.png" style="height:auto; width:auto; "> <br>
Phosphine is weakly basic and like ammonia, gives phosphonium
compounds with acids e.g.,<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic32.png" style="height:auto; width:auto; "> <br>
<em>Uses:</em> The spontaneous combustion of phosphine is technically used in Holme’s
signals. Containers containing calcium carbide and calcium phosphide are
pierced and thrown in the sea when the gases evolved burn and serve as a
signal. It is also used in smoke screens.

<p>
    <b>Phosphorus Halides</b><br>
    Phosphorus forms two types of halides, PX<sub>3</sub> (X = F, Cl, Br, I) and
PX<sub>5</sub> (X = F, Cl, Br).<br>
<b>Phosphorus Trichloride</b><br>
    <b>Preparation:</b>
    It is obtained by passing dry chlorine over heated white phosphorus.<br>

<b>Properties:</b><br>
PCl<sub>5</sub> is a yellowish white powder and in moist air, it hydrolyses to
POCl<sub>3</sub> and finally gets converted to phosphoric acid.<br>

        It is used in the synthesis of some organic
        compounds, e.g., C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl, CH<sub>3</sub>COCl.<br><br>
        In gaseous and liquid phases, it has a trigonal
        bipyramidal structure as shown. The three equatorial
        P–Cl bonds are equivalent, while the two axial bonds are
        longer than equatorial bonds. This is due to the fact that
        the axial bond pairs suffer more repulsion as compared
        to equatorial bond pairs.<br><br>
        In the solid state it exists as an ionic solid,

    <b>Oxoacids of Phosphorus:</b><br>
    Phosphorus forms a number of oxoacids. The important oxoacids of
phosphorus with their formulas, methods of preparation and the
presence of some characteristic bonds in their structures are given
in Table.<br>
<img src="pic_pblock/pic44.png" style="height:auto; width:auto; "> <br>
The compositions of the oxoacids are interrelated in terms of loss
or gain of H<sub>2</sub>O molecule or O-atom.<br><br>
The structures of some important oxoacids are given below:<br>

In oxoacids phosphorus is tetrahedrally surrounded by other atoms.
All these acids contain at least one P=O bond and one P–OH bond. The
oxoacids in which phosphorus has lower oxidation state (less than +5)
contain, in addition to P=O and P–OH bonds, either P–P (e.g., in H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)
or P–H (e.g., in H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>) bonds but not both. These acids in +3 oxidation
state of phosphorus tend to disproportionate to higher and lower
oxidation states. For example, orthophophorous acid (or phosphorous
acid) on heating disproportionates to give orthophosphoric acid (or
phosphoric acid) and phosphine.<br>

The acids which contain P–H bond have strong reducing properties.
Thus, hypophosphorous acid is a good reducing agent as it contains
two P–H bonds and reduces, for example, AgNO<sub>3</sub> to metallic silver.<br>

These P–H bonds are not ionisable to give H+ and do not play any
role in basicity. Only those H atoms which are attached with oxygen in
P–OH form are ionisable and cause the basicity. Thus, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> and
H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> are dibasic and tribasic, respectively as the structure of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>
has two P–OH bonds and H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> three.
