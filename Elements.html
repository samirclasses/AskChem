<div id="hydrogen">
<h1>Hydrogen</h1>
<p>Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. Hydrogen is the lightest element.
 At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H<sub>2</sub>. 
 It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen is the
 most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter.
 Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on
 Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. For the most common isotope of 
 hydrogen (symbol <sub>1</sub>H<sup>1</sup>) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.</p>

<p>In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first 
second after the Big Bang. The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred
 about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for 
 electrons to remain bound to protons.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is nonmetallic (except it becomes metallic at extremely high pressures) and readily forms
 a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds such as water and nearly
 all organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because 
 these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds,
 hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a 
 positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H<sup>+</sup>. The H<sup>+</sup> cation is simply a proton
 (symbol p) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of
 its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom
 for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, the study of its energetics and
 chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. 
In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, 
and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means "water-former".</p>

<p>Industrial production is mainly from steam reforming of natural gas, oil reforming, or coal gasification. 
A small percentage is also produced using more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water.
Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel
processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production. It can be burned to produce heat or combined with 
oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity directly, with water being the only emissions at the point of usage.
Hydrogen atoms may embrittle metals.</p>

<div id="helium">
<h1>Helium</h1>
<p>
Helium (from Greek: ἥλιος, romanized: helios, lit. 'sun') is a chemical element with the symbol He and atomic number 2.
 It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the
 periodic table.[a] Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements, and it does not have a melting point at 
 standard pressure. It is the second-lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. 
 It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements 
 combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and Jupiter, because of the very high nuclear binding energy 
 (per nucleon) of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also
 accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. The most common isotope of helium in 
 the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are
 created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.</p>

<p>Helium was first detected as an unknown, yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse 
in 1868 by Georges Rayet, Captain C. T. Haig,[13] Norman R. Pogson, and Lieutenant John Herschel, 
and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen.Janssen is often jointly credited with 
detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar
 eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was 
 due to a new element, which he named after the sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by 
 chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the
 uranium ore, cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite.
 In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by
 far the largest supplier of the gas today.</p>

<p>Liquid helium is used in cryogenics (its largest single use, consuming about a quarter of production),
 and in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with its main commercial application in MRI scanners. Helium's 
 other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding, 
 and in processes such as growing crystal to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced.
 A small but well-known use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density 
 differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of
 the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (helium I and helium II) 
 is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those 
 looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.</p>

<p>On Earth, it is relatively rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today 
is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there 
are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic
 helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted
 commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Terrestrial helium is 
 a non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere, it promptly escapes into space. Its supply
 is thought to be rapidly diminishing.However, some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the 
 earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger-than-expected quantities in some 
 cases having been released by volcanic activity.

<div id="lithium">
<h1>Lithium</h1>
<p>
Lithium (from Ancient Greek λίθος (líthos) 'stone') is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. 
It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense
solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum,
inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. 
It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, 
but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility 
as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is 
isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.
</p>
<p>
The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature 
have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, 
lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light:
it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common.For related reasons, lithium has important uses 
in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction,
and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.
</p>
<p>
Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics,
lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, 
and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.[citation needed][when?]
</p>
<p>
Lithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function.
Lithium-based drugs are useful as a mood stabilizer and antidepressant in the treatment of mental illness such
as bipolar disorder.

<div id="beryllium">
<h1>Beryllium</h1>
<p>
Beryllium is a chemical element with the symbol Be and atomic number 4. It is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and 
brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements
to form minerals. Notable gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald, red beryl) and chrysoberyl.
It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger 
atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused 
into heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust.
The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, 
a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.
</p>
<p>
In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity 
and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, 
missiles, spacecraft, and satellites.Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent 
to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment 
and components of particle detectors.When added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy 
beryllium copper), iron, or nickel, beryllium improves many physical properties.For example, tools and components 
made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In air, 
the surface of beryllium oxidizes readily at room temperature to form a passivation layer 1–10 nm thick that protects 
it from further oxidation and corrosion. The metal oxidizes in bulk (beyond the passivation layer) when heated 
above 500°C (932°F), and burns brilliantly when heated to about 2500°C (4,530°F).
</p>
<p>
The commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all
times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic 
disease in some people called berylliosis.Berylliosis causes pneumonia and other associated respiratory illness.

</div>
<div id="boron">
<h1>Boron</h1>
<p>
Boron is a chemical element with the symbol B and atomic number 5. In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, 
lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder. As the lightest element of the boron group it has 
three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds, resulting in many compounds such as boric acid, the mineral 
sodium borate, and the ultra-hard crystals of boron carbide and boron nitride.
</p>
<p>
Boron is synthesized entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, 
so it is a low-abundance element in the Solar System and in the Earth's crust.It constitutes about
 0.001 percent by weight of Earth's crust. It is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of 
 its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, 
 such as borax and kernite. The largest known deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.
</p>
<p>
Elemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron
is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, the very pure element is produced with difficulty 
because of contamination by carbon or other elements that resist removal.Several allotropes exist: 
amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), 
and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of the element itself is as boron filaments with
applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.
</p>
<p>
Boron is primarily used in chemical compounds. About half of all production consumed globally is an additive in
fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, 
lightweight structural and heat-resistant materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal
shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. As sodium perborate, it is used as a bleach. A small amount is used as a 
dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing
organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.
</p>
<p>
The intersection of boron with biology is very small. Consensus on it as essential for mammalian life is lacking.
Borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt) but are more toxic to arthropods and are occasionally 
used as insecticides. Boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Although only traces are required, it is an 
essential plant nutrient.
</p>
</div>
 <div id="carbon">
<h1>Carbon</h1>
<p>
 Carbon is a Group 14 element and is distributed very widely in nature. It is found in abundance in the sun, stars, comets, and atmospheres of most planets. 
 Carbon is present as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and dissolved in all natural waters. It is a component of rocks as carbonates of calcium (limestone), 
 magnesium, and iron. The atmosphere of Mars is very thin but what there is contains about 95 % CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>

Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are chiefly hydrocarbons. Carbon is unique among the elements in the vast number of variety of compounds it can form.
 Organic chemistry, a 1/112th subset of inorganic chemistry, is the study of carbon and its compounds. While silicon might take the place of carbon in 
 forming a host of related compounds, it is not possible currently to form stable compounds with very long chains of silicon atoms.<br>
 Carbon is found free in nature in three allotropic forms: amorphous, graphite, and diamond. Graphite is one of the softest known materials while 
 diamond is one of the hardest. Carbon, as microscopic diamonds, is found in some meteorites. Natural diamonds are found in ancient volcanic "pipes" 
 such as found in South Africa. Diamonds are also recovered from the ocean floor off the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
 Pure carbon is available in a number of different forms (allotropes). The most common form of pure carbon is α-graphite. 
 This is also the thermodynamically most stable form. Diamond is a second form of carbon but is much less common. Other forms of carbon include the fullerenes. 
 Whereas diamond and graphite are infinite lattices, fullerenes such as buckminsterfullerene, C<sub>60</sub>, is a discrete molecular species. Amorphous forms of carbon 
 such as soot and lampblack are materials consisting of very small particles of graphite.

  <div id="nitrogen">
<h1>Nitrogen</h1>
<p>
Nitrogen is a chemical element; it has symbol N and atomic number 7. Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, 
 often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. 
 At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, 
 making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.<br>

It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. 
 The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. 
 Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός "no life", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of 
 languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.<br>

Elemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert 
 (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. 
 Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. 
 The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO),[8] 
 dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time 
 it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. 
 Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems. 
 Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and 
 cyanoacrylate used in superglue.<br>

Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule 
 adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. 
 The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. 
 Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural 
 nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. 
 Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.

 </div>

<div id="oxygen">
<h1>Oxygen</h1>
<p>
 Oxygen is a chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily 
 forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth's crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.<br>

At standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O
2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth's history. 
 Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.<br>

All eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of 
 oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory 
 organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, 
 where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body's circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular 
 respiration takes place.However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.<br>

Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, 
 teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon 
 energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a
 free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, 
 ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at 
 the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.<br>

Oxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph 
 Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen "dephlogisticated air", and did not recognize it as a 
 chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.<br>

Common industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support
 systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.
</p>
</div>

<div id="fluorine">
<h1>Fluorine</h1>
<p>
Fluorine is a chemical element; it has symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen[note 1] and exists at standard conditions as pale yellow diatomic gas. Fluorine is extremely reactive as it 
 reacts with all other elements except for the light inert gases. It is highly toxic.<br>

Among the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in cosmic abundance and 13th in crustal abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source of fluorine, which gave the element its name, was first described in 1529; 
 as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and 
 dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using 
 low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project 
 in World War II.<br>

Owing to the expense of refining pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into 
 hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminium refining. The carbon–fluorine bond is usually very stable. Organofluorine compounds are 
 widely used as refrigerants, electrical insulation, and PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain C−F bonds. The fluoride ion from dissolved fluoride salts inhibits dental 
 cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.<br>

Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 23,500 times that of carbon dioxide, and SF6 has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. 
 Organofluorine compounds often persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few plants and marine sponges synthesize 
 organofluorine poisons (most often monofluoroacetates) that help deter predation.

<div id="neon">
<h1>Neon</h1>
<p>
 Neon is a chemical element; it has the symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is the second noble gas in the periodic table.[13] Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, 
 with approximately two-thirds the density of air.<br>

Neon was discovered in 1898 alongside krypton and xenon, identified as one of the three remaining rare inert elements in dry air after the removal of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide. 
 Its discovery was marked by the distinctive bright red emission spectrum it exhibited, leading to its immediate recognition as a new element. The name neon originates from the Greek word νέον, 
 a neuter singular form of νέος (neos), meaning 'new'. Neon is a chemically inert gas, with no known uncharged neon compounds. Existing neon compounds are primarily ionic molecules or fragile 
 molecules held together by van der Waals forces.<br>

The synthesis of most neon in the cosmos resulted from the nuclear fusion within stars of oxygen and helium through the alpha-capture process. Despite its abundant presence in the universe and 
 Solar System—ranking fifth in cosmic abundance following hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon—neon is comparatively scarce on Earth. It constitutes about 18.2 ppm of Earth's atmospheric volume 
 and a lesser fraction in the Earth's crust. The high volatility of neon and its inability to form compounds that would anchor it to solids explain its limited presence on Earth and the inner 
 terrestrial planets. Neon’s high volatility facilitated its escape from planetesimals under the early Solar System's nascent Sun's warmth.<br>

Neon's notable applications include its use in low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes, and neon advertising signs, where it emits a distinct reddish-orange glow.
 This same red emission line is responsible for the characteristic red light of helium–neon lasers. Although neon has some applications in plasma tubes and as a refrigerant, its commercial
 uses are relatively limited. It is primarily obtained through the fractional distillation of liquid air, making it significantly more expensive than helium due to air being its sole source.
