<div id="hydrogen">
<h1>Hydrogen</h1>
<p>Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. Hydrogen is the lightest element.
 At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H<sub>2</sub>. 
 It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen is the
 most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter.
 Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on
 Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds. For the most common isotope of 
 hydrogen (symbol <sub>1</sub>H<sup>1</sup>) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.</p>

<p>In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first 
second after the Big Bang. The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred
 about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for 
 electrons to remain bound to protons.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is nonmetallic (except it becomes metallic at extremely high pressures) and readily forms
 a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds such as water and nearly
 all organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because 
 these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds,
 hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a 
 positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H<sup>+</sup>. The H<sup>+</sup> cation is simply a proton
 (symbol p) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of
 its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom
 for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, the study of its energetics and
 chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. 
In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, 
and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means "water-former".</p>

<p>Industrial production is mainly from steam reforming of natural gas, oil reforming, or coal gasification. 
A small percentage is also produced using more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water.
Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel
processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production. It can be burned to produce heat or combined with 
oxygen in fuel cells to generate electricity directly, with water being the only emissions at the point of usage.
Hydrogen atoms may embrittle metals.</p>

<div id="helium">
<h1>Helium</h1>
<p>
Helium (from Greek: ἥλιος, romanized: helios, lit. 'sun') is a chemical element with the symbol He and atomic number 2.
 It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the
 periodic table.[a] Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements, and it does not have a melting point at 
 standard pressure. It is the second-lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. 
 It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements 
 combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and Jupiter, because of the very high nuclear binding energy 
 (per nucleon) of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also
 accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. The most common isotope of helium in 
 the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are
 created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.</p>

<p>Helium was first detected as an unknown, yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse 
in 1868 by Georges Rayet, Captain C. T. Haig,[13] Norman R. Pogson, and Lieutenant John Herschel, 
and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen.Janssen is often jointly credited with 
detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar
 eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was 
 due to a new element, which he named after the sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by 
 chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the
 uranium ore, cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite.
 In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by
 far the largest supplier of the gas today.</p>

<p>Liquid helium is used in cryogenics (its largest single use, consuming about a quarter of production),
 and in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with its main commercial application in MRI scanners. Helium's 
 other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding, 
 and in processes such as growing crystal to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced.
 A small but well-known use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density 
 differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of
 the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (helium I and helium II) 
 is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those 
 looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.</p>

<p>On Earth, it is relatively rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today 
is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there 
are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic
 helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted
 commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Terrestrial helium is 
 a non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere, it promptly escapes into space. Its supply
 is thought to be rapidly diminishing.However, some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the 
 earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger-than-expected quantities in some 
 cases having been released by volcanic activity.

<div id="lithium">
<h1>Lithium</h1>
<p>
Lithium (from Ancient Greek λίθος (líthos) 'stone') is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. 
It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense
solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum,
inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. 
It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, 
but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility 
as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is 
isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.
</p>
<p>
The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature 
have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, 
lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light:
it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common.For related reasons, lithium has important uses 
in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction,
and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.
</p>
<p>
Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics,
lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, 
and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.[citation needed][when?]
</p>
<p>
Lithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function.
Lithium-based drugs are useful as a mood stabilizer and antidepressant in the treatment of mental illness such
as bipolar disorder.

</div>
<div id="beryllium">
<h1>Beryllium</h1>
<p>
Beryllium is a chemical element with the symbol Be and atomic number 4. It is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and 
brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements
to form minerals. Notable gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald, red beryl) and chrysoberyl.
It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger 
atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused 
into heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust.
The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, 
a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.
</p>
<p>
In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity 
and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, 
missiles, spacecraft, and satellites.Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent 
to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment 
and components of particle detectors.When added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy 
beryllium copper), iron, or nickel, beryllium improves many physical properties.For example, tools and components 
made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In air, 
the surface of beryllium oxidizes readily at room temperature to form a passivation layer 1–10 nm thick that protects 
it from further oxidation and corrosion. The metal oxidizes in bulk (beyond the passivation layer) when heated 
above 500°C (932°F), and burns brilliantly when heated to about 2500°C (4,530°F).
</p>
<p>
The commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all
times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic 
disease in some people called berylliosis.Berylliosis causes pneumonia and other associated respiratory illness.
</p>
</div>
<div id="boron">
<h1>Boron</h1>
<p>
Boron is a chemical element with the symbol B and atomic number 5. In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, 
lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder. As the lightest element of the boron group it has 
three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds, resulting in many compounds such as boric acid, the mineral 
sodium borate, and the ultra-hard crystals of boron carbide and boron nitride.
</p>
<p>
Boron is synthesized entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, 
so it is a low-abundance element in the Solar System and in the Earth's crust.It constitutes about
 0.001 percent by weight of Earth's crust. It is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of 
 its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, 
 such as borax and kernite. The largest known deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.
</p>
<p>
Elemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron
is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, the very pure element is produced with difficulty 
because of contamination by carbon or other elements that resist removal.Several allotropes exist: 
amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), 
and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of the element itself is as boron filaments with
applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.
</p>
<p>
Boron is primarily used in chemical compounds. About half of all production consumed globally is an additive in
fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, 
lightweight structural and heat-resistant materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal
shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. As sodium perborate, it is used as a bleach. A small amount is used as a 
dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing
organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.
</p>
<p>
The intersection of boron with biology is very small. Consensus on it as essential for mammalian life is lacking.
Borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt) but are more toxic to arthropods and are occasionally 
used as insecticides. Boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Although only traces are required, it is an 
essential plant nutrient.
</p>
</div>
 <div id="carbon">
<h1>Carbon</h1>
<p>
 Carbon is a Group 14 element and is distributed very widely in nature. It is found in abundance in the sun, stars, comets, and atmospheres of most planets. 
 Carbon is present as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and dissolved in all natural waters. It is a component of rocks as carbonates of calcium (limestone), 
 magnesium, and iron. The atmosphere of Mars is very thin but what there is contains about 95 % CO<sub>2</sub>.<br>

Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are chiefly hydrocarbons. Carbon is unique among the elements in the vast number of variety of compounds it can form.
 Organic chemistry, a 1/112th subset of inorganic chemistry, is the study of carbon and its compounds. While silicon might take the place of carbon in 
 forming a host of related compounds, it is not possible currently to form stable compounds with very long chains of silicon atoms.<br>
 Carbon is found free in nature in three allotropic forms: amorphous, graphite, and diamond. Graphite is one of the softest known materials while 
 diamond is one of the hardest. Carbon, as microscopic diamonds, is found in some meteorites. Natural diamonds are found in ancient volcanic "pipes" 
 such as found in South Africa. Diamonds are also recovered from the ocean floor off the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
 Pure carbon is available in a number of different forms (allotropes). The most common form of pure carbon is α-graphite. 
 This is also the thermodynamically most stable form. Diamond is a second form of carbon but is much less common. Other forms of carbon include the fullerenes. 
 Whereas diamond and graphite are infinite lattices, fullerenes such as buckminsterfullerene, C<sub>60</sub>, is a discrete molecular species. Amorphous forms of carbon 
 such as soot and lampblack are materials consisting of very small particles of graphite.

  <div id="nitrogen">
<h1>Nitrogen</h1>
<p>
Nitrogen is a chemical element; it has symbol N and atomic number 7. Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, 
 often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. 
 At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth's atmosphere, 
 making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.<br>

It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. 
 The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. 
 Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός "no life", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of 
 languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.<br>

Elemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert 
 (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. 
 Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. 
 The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO),[8] 
 dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time 
 it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. 
 Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems. 
 Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and 
 cyanoacrylate used in superglue.<br>

Nitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule 
 adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. 
 The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. 
 Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural 
 nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. 
 Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.

 </div>

<div id="oxygen">
<h1>Oxygen</h1>
<p>
 Oxygen is a chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily 
 forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth's crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.<br>

At standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O
2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth's history. 
 Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.<br>

All eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of 
 oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory 
 organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, 
 where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body's circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular 
 respiration takes place.However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.<br>

Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, 
 teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon 
 energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a
 free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, 
 ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at 
 the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.<br>

Oxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph 
 Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen "dephlogisticated air", and did not recognize it as a 
 chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.<br>

Common industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support
 systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.

</div>

<div id="fluorine">
<h1>Fluorine</h1>
<p>
Fluorine is a chemical element; it has symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen[note 1] and exists at standard conditions as pale yellow diatomic gas. Fluorine is extremely reactive as it 
 reacts with all other elements except for the light inert gases. It is highly toxic.<br>

Among the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in cosmic abundance and 13th in crustal abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source of fluorine, which gave the element its name, was first described in 1529; 
 as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and 
 dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using 
 low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project 
 in World War II.<br>

Owing to the expense of refining pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into 
 hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminium refining. The carbon–fluorine bond is usually very stable. Organofluorine compounds are 
 widely used as refrigerants, electrical insulation, and PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain C−F bonds. The fluoride ion from dissolved fluoride salts inhibits dental 
 cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.<br>

Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 23,500 times that of carbon dioxide, and SF6 has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. 
 Organofluorine compounds often persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few plants and marine sponges synthesize 
 organofluorine poisons (most often monofluoroacetates) that help deter predation.

</div>

<div id="neon">
<h1>Neon</h1>
<p>
 Neon is a chemical element; it has the symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is the second noble gas in the periodic table.[13] Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, 
 with approximately two-thirds the density of air.<br>

Neon was discovered in 1898 alongside krypton and xenon, identified as one of the three remaining rare inert elements in dry air after the removal of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide. 
 Its discovery was marked by the distinctive bright red emission spectrum it exhibited, leading to its immediate recognition as a new element. The name neon originates from the Greek word νέον, 
 a neuter singular form of νέος (neos), meaning 'new'. Neon is a chemically inert gas, with no known uncharged neon compounds. Existing neon compounds are primarily ionic molecules or fragile 
 molecules held together by van der Waals forces.<br>

The synthesis of most neon in the cosmos resulted from the nuclear fusion within stars of oxygen and helium through the alpha-capture process. Despite its abundant presence in the universe and 
 Solar System—ranking fifth in cosmic abundance following hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon—neon is comparatively scarce on Earth. It constitutes about 18.2 ppm of Earth's atmospheric volume 
 and a lesser fraction in the Earth's crust. The high volatility of neon and its inability to form compounds that would anchor it to solids explain its limited presence on Earth and the inner 
 terrestrial planets. Neon’s high volatility facilitated its escape from planetesimals under the early Solar System's nascent Sun's warmth.<br>

Neon's notable applications include its use in low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes, and neon advertising signs, where it emits a distinct reddish-orange glow.
 This same red emission line is responsible for the characteristic red light of helium–neon lasers. Although neon has some applications in plasma tubes and as a refrigerant, its commercial
 uses are relatively limited. It is primarily obtained through the fractional distillation of liquid air, making it significantly more expensive than helium due to air being its sole source.

</div>

<div id="sodium">
<h1>Sodium</h1>
<p>
 Sodium is a chemical element; it has symbol Na (from Neo-Latin natrium) and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 
 of the periodic table. Its only stable isotope is <sup>23</sup>Na. The free metal does not occur in nature and must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's 
 crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite, and halite (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the 
 Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.<br>

Sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Among many other useful sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide (lye) is used in soap manufacture, and 
 sodium chloride (edible salt) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.<br>

Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure.
 Animal cells actively pump sodium ions out of the cells by means of the sodium–potassium pump, an enzyme complex embedded in the cell membrane, in order to maintain a roughly ten-times higher
 concentration of sodium ions outside the cell than inside.[10] In nerve cells, the sudden flow of sodium ions into the cell through voltage-gated sodium channels enables transmission of a nerve
 impulse in a process called the action potential.

</div>

<div id="magnesium">
<h1>Magnesium</h1>
<p>
 Magnesium is a chemical element; it has symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray metal having a low density, low melting point and high chemical reactivity. Like the other alkaline earth metals 
(group 2 of the periodic table) it occurs naturally only in combination with other elements and almost always has an oxidation state of +2. It reacts readily with air to form a thin passivation coating of 
magnesium oxide that inhibits further corrosion of the metal. The free metal burns with a brilliant-white light. The metal is obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. It is
less dense than aluminium and is used primarily as a component in strong and lightweight alloys that contain aluminium.<br>

In the cosmos, magnesium is produced in large, aging stars by the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus. When such stars explode as supernovas, much of the magnesium is expelled
into the interstellar medium where it may recycle into new star systems. Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust[13] and the fourth most common element in the Earth (after iron, 
oxygen and silicon), making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planet's mantle. It is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater, after sodium and chlorine.<br>

This element is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body and is essential to all cells and some 300 enzymes.[15] Magnesium ions interact with polyphosphate compounds such as ATP, DNA, and RNA. 
Hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions to function. Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives and antacids (such as milk of magnesia), and to stabilize abnormal nerve excitation or blood 
vessel spasm in such conditions as eclampsia.

<div id="aluminium">
<h1>Aluminium</h1>
<p>
 Aluminium (or aluminum in North American English) is a chemical element; it has symbol Al and atomic number 13. Aluminium has a density lower than that of other common metals, about one-third that of steel.
 It has a great affinity towards oxygen, forming a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. Aluminium visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. 
 It is soft, nonmagnetic, and ductile. It has one stable isotope, 27Al, which is highly abundant, making aluminium the twelfth-most common element in the universe. The radioactivity of 26Al leads to it being used 
 in radiometric dating.<br>

Chemically, aluminium is a post-transition metal in the boron group; as is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The aluminium cation Al3+ is small and highly charged; 
as such, it has more polarizing power, and bonds formed by aluminium have a more covalent character. The strong affinity of aluminium for oxygen leads to the common occurrence of its oxides in nature. Aluminium is 
found on Earth primarily in rocks in the crust, where it is the third-most abundant element, after oxygen and silicon, rather than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free metal. It is obtained industrially 
by mining bauxite, a sedimentary rock rich in aluminium minerals.<br>

The discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. The first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville in 1856. 
Aluminium became much more available to the public with the Hall–Héroult process developed independently by French engineer Paul Héroult and American engineer Charles Martin Hall in 1886, and the mass production 
of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life. In the First and Second World Wars, aluminium was a crucial strategic resource for aviation. In 1954, aluminium became the most produced non-ferrous 
metal, surpassing copper. In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.<br>

Despite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to metabolize aluminium salts, but this aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of the abundance of these salts, 
the potential for a biological role for them is of interest, and studies are ongoing.

Silicon is a chemical element; it has symbol Si and atomic number 14. It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic luster, and is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor. It is a member of group 14 in 
the periodic table: carbon is above it; and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Silicon is a significant element that is essential for several physiological and metabolic 
processes in plants. Silicon is widely regarded as the predominant semiconductor material due to its versatile applications in various electrical devices such as transistors, solar cells, integrated circuits,
and others. These may be due to its significant band gap, expansive optical transmission range, extensive absorption spectrum, surface roughening, and effective anti-reflection coating.<br>

Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that Jöns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. Its oxides form a family of anions known as 
silicates. Its melting and boiling points of 1414 °C and 3265 °C, respectively, are the second highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being surpassed only by boron.<br>

Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. It is widely distributed throughout space in cosmic dusts, planetoids, 
and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth's 
crust (about 28% by mass), after oxygen.<br>

Most silicon is used commercially without being separated, often with very little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with clays, silica sand, and stone. Silicates are 
used in Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in 
traditional silicate-based soda–lime glass and many other specialty glasses. Silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of 
the widely used synthetic polymers called silicones.<br>

The late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the Digital Age or Information Age) because of the large impact that elemental silicon has on the modern world economy. 
The small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics (<15%) is essential to the transistors and integrated circuit chips used in most modern technology such as smartphones 
and other computers. In 2019, 32.4% of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices, and the semiconductors industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027.<br>

Silicon is an essential element in biology. Only traces are required by most animals, but some sea sponges and microorganisms, such as diatoms and radiolaria, secrete skeletal structures made of silica. 
Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.

<div id="phosphorous">
<h1>Phosphorous</h1>
<p>
Phosphorus is a chemical element; it has symbol P and atomic number 15. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus and red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never 
found as a free element on Earth. It has a concentration in the Earth's crust of about 0.1%, less abundant than hydrogen but more than manganese. In minerals, phosphorus generally occurs as phosphate.<br>

Elemental phosphorus was first isolated as white phosphorus in 1669. In white phosphorus, phosphorus atoms are arranged in groups of 4, written as P4. White phosphorus emits a faint glow when exposed to oxygen – hence, 
a name, taken from Greek mythology, Φωσφόρος meaning 'light-bearer' (Latin Lucifer), referring to the "Morning Star", the planet Venus. The term phosphorescence, meaning glow after illumination, has its origin in 
phosphorus, although phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence: phosphorus glows due to oxidation of the white (but not red) phosphorus – a process now called chemiluminescence. Phosphorus is classified
as a pnictogen, together with nitrogen, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and moscovium.<br>

Phosphorus is an element essential to sustaining life largely through phosphates, compounds containing the phosphate ion, PO43−. Phosphates are a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds 
fundamental to cells. Elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human urine, and bone ash was an important early phosphate source. Phosphate mines contain fossils because phosphate is present in the fossilized 
deposits of animal remains and excreta. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in a number of plant ecosystems. The vast majority of phosphorus compounds mined are consumed as fertilisers. Phosphate 
is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil, and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population. Other applications include organophosphorus compounds 
in detergents, pesticides, and nerve agents.

<div id="sulphur">
<h1>Sulphur</h1>
<p>
Sulfur (also spelled sulphur in British English) is a chemical element; it has symbol S and atomic number 16. It is abundant, multivalent and nonmetallic. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic 
octatomic molecules with the chemical formula S8. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow, crystalline solid at room temperature.<br>

Sulfur is the tenth most abundant element by mass in the universe and the fifth most common on Earth. Though sometimes found in pure, native form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals. 
Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in ancient India, ancient Greece, China, and ancient Egypt. Historically and in literature sulfur is also called 
brimstone,[8] which means "burning stone".[9] Almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum.The greatest commercial 
use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers, and other chemical processes. Sulfur is used in matches, insecticides, and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are 
odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, bad breath, grapefruit, and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide gives the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other 
biological processes.<br>

Sulfur is an essential element for all life, almost always in the form of organosulfur compounds or metal sulfides. Amino acids (two proteinogenic: cysteine and methionine, and many other non-coded: 
cystine, taurine, etc.) and two vitamins (biotin and thiamine) are organosulfur compounds crucial for life. Many cofactors also contain sulfur, including glutathione, and iron–sulfur proteins. Disulfides, 
S–S bonds, confer mechanical strength and insolubility of the (among others) protein keratin, found in outer skin, hair, and feathers. Sulfur is one of the core chemical elements needed for biochemical 
functioning and is an elemental macronutrient for all living organisms.

<div id="chlorine">
<h1>Chlorine</h1>
<p>
Chlorine is a chemical element; it has symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly 
intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity
and the third-highest electronegativity on the revised Pauling scale, behind only oxygen and fluorine.<br>

Chlorine played an important role in the experiments conducted by medieval alchemists, which commonly involved the heating of chloride salts like ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac) and sodium chloride (common salt), 
producing various chemical substances containing chlorine such as hydrogen chloride, mercury(II) chloride (corrosive sublimate), and aqua regia. However, the nature of free chlorine gas as a separate substance 
was only recognised around 1630 by Jan Baptist van Helmont. Carl Wilhelm Scheele wrote a description of chlorine gas in 1774, supposing it to be an oxide of a new element. In 1809, chemists suggested that the 
gas might be a pure element, and this was confirmed by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810, who named it after the Ancient Greek χλωρός (khlōrós, "pale green") because of its colour.<br>

Because of its great reactivity, all chlorine in the Earth's crust is in the form of ionic chloride compounds, which includes table salt. It is the second-most abundant halogen (after fluorine) and 20th most 
abundant element in Earth's crust. These crystal deposits are nevertheless dwarfed by the huge reserves of chloride in seawater.<br>

Elemental chlorine is commercially produced from brine by electrolysis, predominantly in the chloralkali process. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine led to the development of commercial 
bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals 
such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), many intermediates for the production of plastics, and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating 
compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentration is extremely dangerous, and poisonous to most living organisms. As a chemical warfare agent, 
chlorine was first used in World War I as a poison gas weapon.<br>

In the form of chloride ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from 
inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by 
oxidation of chloride ions in neutrophils as part of an immune system response against bacteria.

<div id="argon">
<h1>Argon</h1>
<p>
Argon is a chemical element; it has symbol Ar and atomic number 18. It is in group 18 of the periodic table and is a noble gas. Argon is the third most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). 
It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). 
Argon is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.<br>

Nearly all argon in Earth's atmosphere is radiogenic argon-40, derived from the decay of potassium-40 in Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope, as it is the most 
easily produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas.<br>

The name "argon" is derived from the Greek word ἀργόν, neuter singular form of ἀργός meaning 'lazy' or 'inactive', as a reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. 
The complete octet (eight electrons) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its triple point temperature of 83.8058 K is a defining fixed point in 
the International Temperature Scale of 1990.<br>

Argon is extracted industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. It is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily
unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. It is also used in incandescent and fluorescent lighting, 
and other gas-discharge tubes. It makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. It is also used in fluorescent glow starters.

<div id="potassium">
<h1>Potassium</h1>
<p>
Potassium is a chemical element; it has symbol K (from Neo-Latin kalium) and atomic number 19. It is a silvery white metal that is soft enough to easily cut with a knife.[8] Potassium metal reacts rapidly 
with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, 
potassium is one of the alkali metals, all of which have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge 
(which combines with anions to form salts). In nature, potassium occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in 
the reaction, and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in seawater (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase, a common constituent of 
granites and other igneous rocks.<br>

Potassium is chemically very similar to sodium, the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table. They have a similar first ionization energy, which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron. 
It was first suggested in 1702 that they were distinct elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts,[12] which was demonstrated in 1807 when elemental potassium was first isolated via electrolysis.  
 Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes, of which <sup>40</sup>K is radioactive. Traces of <sup>40</sup>K are found in all potassium, and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body.<br>

Potassium ions are vital for the functioning of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions across nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each 
result in numerous signs and symptoms, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds 
to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, by shifting potassium from outside to inside cells and increasing potassium excretion by the kidneys.<br>

Most industrial applications of potassium exploit the high solubility of its compounds in water, such as saltwater soap. Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium, and this can be remedied 
with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium, accounting for 95% of global potassium chemical production.

 <div id="calcium">
<h1>Calcium</h1>
<p>
Calcium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ca and atomic number 20. As an alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer when exposed to air. Its physical and chemical 
 properties are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust, and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common 
 calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium. The name derives from Latin 
 calx "lime", which was obtained from heating limestone.<br>

Some calcium compounds were known to the ancients, though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century. Pure calcium was isolated in 1808 via electrolysis of its oxide by Humphry Davy, who named the 
 element. Calcium compounds are widely used in many industries: in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation, in the paper industry as bleaches, as components in cement and electrical insulators, 
 and in the manufacture of soaps. On the other hand, the metal in pure form has few applications due to its high reactivity; still, in small quantities it is often used as an alloying component in steelmaking, 
 and sometimes, as a calcium–lead alloy, in making automotive batteries.<br>

Calcium is the most abundant metal and the fifth-most abundant element in the human body.As electrolytes, calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) play a vital role in the physiological and biochemical processes of organisms 
 and cells: in signal transduction pathways where they act as a second messenger; in neurotransmitter release from neurons; in contraction of all muscle cell types; as cofactors in many enzymes; and in 
 fertilization. Calcium ions outside cells are important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, protein synthesis, and bone formation.

 <div id="scandium">
<h1>Scandium</h1>
<p>
Scandium is a chemical element with the symbol Sc and atomic number 21. It is a silvery-white metallic d-block element. Historically, it has been classified as a rare-earth element,
 together with yttrium and the lanthanides. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.<br>

Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and 
 difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s, when the positive effects of scandium
 on aluminium alloys were discovered. Its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of scandium oxide is 15–20 tonnes per year.<br>

The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium, just as there is
 between beryllium and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3, the predominant oxidation state is +3.

</div>

 <div id="titanium">
<h1>Titanium</h1>
<p>
Titanium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ti and atomic number 22. Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and 
 high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.<br>

Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of minerals, 
 principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal 
 is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments.
 Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl<sub>3</sub>), which is used as a catalyst in the 
 production of polypropylene.<br>

Titanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements. The resulting titanium alloys are strong, lightweight, and versatile, with applications including aerospace 
 (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), sporting goods, jewelry,
 and consumer electronics. Titanium is also considered one of the most biocompatible metals, leading to a range of medical applications including prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental implants, 
 and surgical instruments.<br>

The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, 
 but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, <sup>46</sup>Ti through <sup>50</sup>Ti, with <sup>48</sup>Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).

 <div id="vanadium">
<h1>Vanadium</h1>
<p>
Vanadium is a chemical element; it has symbol V and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery-grey, malleable transition metal. The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, but once isolated artificially, 
 the formation of an oxide layer (passivation) somewhat stabilizes the free metal against further oxidation.<br>

Spanish-Mexican scientist Andrés Manuel del Río discovered compounds of vanadium in 1801 by analyzing a new lead-bearing mineral he called "brown lead". Though he initially presumed its qualities were 
 due to the presence of a new element, he was later erroneously convinced by French chemist Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils that the element was just chromium. Then in 1830, Nils Gabriel Sefström 
 generated chlorides of vanadium, thus proving there was a new element, and named it "vanadium" after the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility, Vanadís (Freyja). The name was based on the wide 
 range of colors found in vanadium compounds. Del Río's lead mineral was ultimately named vanadinite for its vanadium content. In 1867, Henry Enfield Roscoe obtained the pure element.<br>

Vanadium occurs naturally in about 65 minerals and fossil fuel deposits. It is produced in China and Russia from steel smelter slag. Other countries produce it either from magnetite directly, 
 flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed tool steels, and some aluminium alloys. The most important 
 industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid. The vanadium redox battery for energy storage may be an important application in the future.<br>

Large amounts of vanadium ions are found in a few organisms, possibly as a toxin. The oxide and some other salts of vanadium have moderate toxicity. Particularly in the ocean, vanadium is used 
 by some life forms as an active center of enzymes, such as the vanadium bromoperoxidase of some ocean algae.

 <div id="chromium">
<h1>Chromium</h1>
<p>
Chromium is a chemical element; it has symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It is the first element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard, and brittle transition metal.

Chromium is valued for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration 
 by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use. Chromium is also greatly valued 
 as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing. Polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the visible spectrum, and almost 90% of infrared light. The name of the element 
 is derived from the Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.<br>

Industrial production of chromium proceeds from chromite ore (mostly FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) to produce ferrochromium, an iron-chromium alloy, by means of aluminothermic or silicothermic reactions.
 Ferrochromium is  then used to produce alloys such as stainless steel. Pure chromium metal is produced by a different process: roasting and leaching of chromite to separate it from iron, followed by reduction with 
 carbon and then aluminium.<br>

Trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) occurs naturally in many foods and is sold as a dietary supplement, although there is insufficient evidence that dietary chromium provides nutritional benefit to people. 
 In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that research on dietary chromium did not justify it to be recognized as an essential nutrient.<br>

While chromium metal and Cr(III) ions are considered non-toxic, chromate and its derivatives, often called "hexavalent chromium", is toxic and carcinogenic. According to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), 
 chromium trioxide that is used in industrial electroplating processes is a "substance of very high concern" (SVHC).

 <div id="manganese">
<h1>Manganese</h1>
<p>
Manganese is a chemical element; it has symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is a hard, brittle, silvery metal, often found in minerals in combination with iron. Manganese was first isolated in the 1770s. 
 It is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels. It improves strength, workability, and resistance to wear. Manganese oxide is used as an 
 oxidising agent; as a rubber additive; and in glass making, fertilisers, and ceramics. Manganese sulfate can be used as a fungicide.<br>

Manganese is also an essential human dietary element, important in macronutrient metabolism, bone formation, and free radical defense systems. It is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes. 
 It is found mostly in the bones, but also the liver, kidneys, and brain. In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.<br>

It is familiar in the laboratory in the form of the deep violet salt potassium permanganate. It occurs at the active sites in some enzymes. Of particular interest is the use of a Mn-O cluster, 
 the oxygen-evolving complex, in the production of oxygen by plants.

 <div id="iron">
<h1>Iron</h1>
<p>
Iron is a chemical element; it has the symbol Fe (from Latin ferrum 'iron') and atomic number 26. It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, 
 by mass, the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state.<br>

Extracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 <sup>o</sup>C (2,730 <sup>o</sup>F), about 500 <sup>o</sup>C (932 <sup>o</sup>F) higher than that required to smelt copper.
 Humans started to master that  process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BC and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys – in some regions, only around 1200 BC. That event is considered
 the transition from  the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their
 mechanical  properties and low cost. The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.<br>

Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. 
 Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. Chemically, 
 the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron 
 forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, −4 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination compounds; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial,
 medical, or research applications.<br>

The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. These two proteins play essential roles in oxygen transport by blood and oxygen 
 storage in muscles. To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing 
 with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.

 <div id="cobalt">
<h1>Cobalt</h1>
<p>
Cobalt is a chemical element; it has symbol Co and atomic number 27. As with nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural 
 meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, somewhat brittle, gray metal.<br>

Cobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since antiquity for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass. The color was long thought to be due to the metal bismuth. 
 Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue pigment-producing minerals. They were so named because they were poor in known metals and gave off poisonous 
 arsenic-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), which was ultimately named for the kobold.<br>

Today, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as cobaltite (CoAsS). The element is more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. 
 The Copperbelt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production. World production in 2016 was 116,000 tonnes (114,000 long tons; 128,000 short tons) 
 (according to Natural Resources Canada), and the DRC alone accounted for more than 50%.<br>

Cobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, and in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give 
 a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a 
 radioactive tracer and for the production of high-energy gamma rays. Cobalt is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst when refining crude oil. This is to purge it of sulfur, which is very polluting
 when burned and causes acid rain.<br>

Cobalt is the active center of a group of coenzymes called cobalamins. Vitamin B12, the best-known example of the type, is an essential vitamin for all animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also a micronutrient 
 for bacteria, algae, and fungi.<br>

The name cobalt derives from a type of ore considered a nuisance by 16th century German silver miners, which in turn may have been named from a spirit or goblin held superstitiously responsible for it; 
 this spirit is considered equitable to the kobold (a household spirit) by some, or, categorized as a gnome (mine spirit) by others.

 <div id="nickel">
<h1>Nickel</h1>
<p>
Nickel is a chemical element; it has symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive,
 but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's
 crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.<br>

Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and
 inner cores.<br>

Use of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the 
 ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals can be green,
 like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel – Nickel's copper – because they produced no copper.<br>

Although most nickel in the earth's crust exists as oxides, economically more important nickel ores are sulfides, especially pentlandite. Major production sites include the Sudbury region, 
 Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, Western Australia, and Norilsk, Russia.<br>

Nickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength 
 between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating.<br>

About 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other
 applications such as in rechargeable batteries,[13] including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy.
 As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for rechargeable batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments.
 Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.

 <div id="copper">
<h1>Copper</h1>
<p>
Copper is a chemical element; it has symbol Cu (from Latin cuprum) and atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity.
 A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys,
 such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.<br>

Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form (native metals). This led to very early human use in several regions, from c. 8000 BC. Thousands of years later,
 it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores, c. 5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another metal, tin, 
 to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.

Commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments.<br>

Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green patina of compounds called verdigris. Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as
 pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.<br>

Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is 
 a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone.
 The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.

<h1>Zinc</h1>
<p>
Zinc is a chemical element with the symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in 
 group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>ions are of similar size.
 Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, 
 Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).<br>

Zinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development.
 It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth as 
 it is an important cofactor for many enzymes.<br>

Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, 
 infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may 
 cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the
 intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.<br>

Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, 
 Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a
 large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks.The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC.
 The oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they
 called "philosopher's wool" or "white snow".<br>

The element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. 
 Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. 
 Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate 
 (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory.

 <div id="galium">
<h1>Galium</h1>
<p>
Gallium is a chemical element; it has the symbol Ga and atomic number 31. Discovered by the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875, gallium is in group 13 of the periodic table and is 
 similar to the other metals of the group (aluminium, indium, and thallium).<br>

Elemental gallium is a relatively soft, silvery metal at standard temperature and pressure. In its liquid state, it becomes silvery white. If enough force is applied, solid gallium may fracture conchoidally.
 Since its discovery in 1875, gallium has widely been used to make alloys with low melting points. It is also used in semiconductors, as a dopant in semiconductor substrates.<br>

The melting point of gallium (29.7646<sup>o</sup>C, 85.5763<sup>o</sup>F, 302.9146 K) is used as a temperature reference point. Gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative
 to mercury, and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury. A melting point of −19<sup>o</sup>C (−2 <sup>o</sup>F), well below the freezing point of water, is claimed for the alloy galinstan 
 (62–⁠95% gallium, 5–⁠22% indium, and 0–⁠16% tin by weight), but that may be the freezing point with the effect of supercooling.<br>

Gallium does not occur as a free element in nature, but rather as gallium(III) compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores (such as sphalerite) and in bauxite. Elemental gallium is a liquid at temperatures greater 
 than 29.76 <sup>o</sup>C (85.57 °F), and will melt in a person's hands at normal human body temperature of 37.0 <sup>o</sup>C (98.6 <sup>o</sup>F).<br>

Gallium is predominantly used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, is used in microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. 
 Semiconducting gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes and diode lasers. Gallium is also used in the production of artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.
 Gallium is considered a technology-critical element by the United States National Library of Medicine and Frontiers Media.<br>

Gallium has no known natural role in biology. Gallium(III) behaves in a similar manner to ferric salts in biological systems and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and
 radiopharmaceuticals.

 <div id="germenium">
<h1>Germanium</h1>
<p>
germanium (Ge), a chemical element between silicon and tin in Group 14 (IVa) of the periodic table, a silvery-gray metalloid, intermediate in properties between the metals and the nonmetals. 
 Although germanium was not discovered until 1886 by Clemens Winkler, a German chemist, its existence, properties, and position in the periodic system had been predicted in 1871 by the Russian chemist 
 Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev, who called the hypothetical element ekasilicon. (The name germanium derives from the Latin word Germania [Germany] and was given to the element by Winkler.) Germanium did 
 not become economically significant until after 1945, when its properties as a semiconductor were recognized as being of value in electronics. Many other substances now also are used as semiconductors,
 but germanium remains of primary importance in the manufacture of transistors and of components for devices such as rectifiers and photocells.<br>

On a weight basis, germanium is a scarce but not an extremely rare (about 1.5 parts per million) element in the crust of the Earth, equaling in abundance beryllium, molybdenum, and cesium and exceeding 
 the elements arsenic, cadmium, antimony, and mercury. In the cosmos the atomic abundance of germanium is 50.5 (based upon Si = 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>), a value roughly equal to those for krypton and zirconium and only 
 slightly less than that for selenium. The cosmic abundance is much less than those of a number of the heavier elements; e.g., bromine, strontium, tin, barium, mercury, and lead. All of the elements of 
 lower nuclear charge than germanium, except beryllium, boron, scandium, and gallium, are cosmically more abundant than germanium. Cosmically, germanium is believed to be one of the many elements formed by 
 neutron absorption after the initial processes of hydrogen and helium burning and alpha-particle absorption.<br>

Germanium is widely distributed in nature but is too reactive to occur free. Primary minerals include argyrodite (from which it was first isolated), germanite, renierite, and canfieldite, all of them rare; 
 only germanite and renierite have been used as commercial sources for the element. Trace quantities of germanium are found in certain zinc blendes, in sulfidic ores of copper and arsenic, and in coals, 
 the latter possibly a consequence of the concentration of the element by plants of the Carboniferous Period in geologic history. Certain present-day plants are known to concentrate germanium. Both zinc-process 
 concentrates and ash and flue dusts from coal-burning installations provide commercial sources of germanium.

 <div id="arsenic">
<h1>Arsenic</h1>
<p>
Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and the atomic number 33. It is a metalloid and one of the pnictogens, and therefore shares many properties with its group 15 neighbors phosphorus and antimony. 
 Arsenic is a notoriously toxic heavy metal. It occurs naturally in many minerals, usually in combination with sulfur and metals, but also as a pure elemental crystal. It has various allotropes, but only 
 the grey form, which has a metallic appearance, is important to industry.<br>

The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of lead (for example, in car batteries and ammunition). Arsenic is a common n-type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices. It is also a component of the III–V compound
 semiconductor gallium arsenide. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of pesticides, treated wood products, herbicides, and insecticides. These applications are declining 
 with the increasing recognition of the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds.<br>

Arsenic has been known since ancient times to be poisonous to humans. However, a few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites. Trace quantities of arsenic have been 
 proposed to be an essential dietary element in rats, hamsters, goats, and chickens. Research has not been conducted to determine whether small amounts of arsenic may play a role in human metabolism.
 However, arsenic poisoning occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed. Arsenic contamination of groundwater is a problem that affects millions of people across the world.<br>

The United States' Environmental Protection Agency states that all forms of arsenic are a serious risk to human health.The United States' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ranked arsenic
 number 1 in its 2001 prioritized list of hazardous substances at Superfund sites. Arsenic is classified as a Group-A carcinogen.

 <div id="selenium">
<h1>Selenium</h1>
<p>
Selenium is a chemical element; it has the symbol Se and atomic number 34. It has various physical appearances, including a brick-red powder, a vitreous black solid, and a grey metallic-looking form. 
 It seldom occurs in this elemental state or as pure ore compounds in Earth's crust. Selenium (from Ancient Greek σελήνη (selḗnē) 'moon') was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity 
 of the new element to the previously discovered tellurium (named for the Earth).<br>

Selenium is found in metal sulfide ores, where it substitutes for sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds 
 are rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly replaced
 with silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.<br>

Although trace amounts of selenium are necessary for cellular function in many animals, including humans, both elemental selenium and (especially) selenium salts are toxic in even small doses, causing selenosis.
 Symptoms include (in decreasing order of frequency): diarrhea, fatigue, hair loss, joint pain, nail brittleness or discoloration, nausea, headache, tingling, vomiting, and fever.<br>

Selenium is listed as an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements, as well as in infant formula, and is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and
 thioredoxin reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants) as well as in three deiodinase enzymes. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, 
 with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently not requiring any.

 <div id="bromine">
<h1>Bromine</h1>
<p>
Bromine is a chemical element; it has symbol Br and atomic number 35. It is a volatile red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured vapour.
 Its properties are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name was
 derived from Ancient Greek βρῶμος (bromos) 'stench', referring to its sharp and pungent smell.<br>

Elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur as a free element in nature. Instead, it can be isolated from colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts analogous to table salt, a 
 property it shares with the other halogens. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br<sup>-</sup>) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element 
 is easily extracted from brine evaporation ponds, mostly in the United States and Israel. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth that of chlorine.<br>

At standard conditions for temperature and pressure it is a liquid; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is mercury. At high temperatures, organobromine compounds readily dissociate 
 to yield free bromine atoms, a process that stops free radical chemical chain reactions. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as fire retardants, and more than half the bromine produced worldwide
 each year is put to this purpose. The same property causes ultraviolet sunlight to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the atmosphere to yield free bromine atoms, causing ozone depletion. As a result, 
 many organobromine compounds—such as the pesticide methyl bromide—are no longer used. Bromine compounds are still used in well drilling fluids, in photographic film, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of 
 organic chemicals.<br>

Large amounts of bromide salts are toxic from the action of soluble bromide ions, causing bromism. However, bromine is beneficial for human eosinophils, and is an essential trace element for collagen
 development in all animals. Hundreds of known organobromine compounds are generated by terrestrial and marine plants and animals, and some serve important biological roles. As a pharmaceutical, 
 the simple bromide ion (Br<sup>-</sup>) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses 
 as antiepileptics.

<div id="kripton">
<h1>Kripton</h1>
<p>
Krypton (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptos 'the hidden one') is a chemical element; it has symbol Kr and atomic number 36. It is a colorless, odorless noble gas that occurs in trace amounts in
 the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. Krypton is chemically inert.<br>

Krypton, like the other noble gases, is used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has many spectral lines, and krypton plasma is useful in bright, high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers),
 each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. Krypton fluoride also makes a useful laser medium. From 1960 to 1983, the official definition of the metre was based on the wavelength of one spectral 
 line of krypton-86, because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes.<br>

 Krypton was discovered in Britain in 1898 by William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air. Neon was discovered
 by a similar procedure by the same workers just a few weeks later. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton.<br>

In 1960, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures defined the meter as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of light emitted in the vacuum corresponding to the transition between the 2p<sup>10</sup> and 5d<sup>5</sup>
 evels in the isotope krypton-86. This agreement replaced the 1889 international prototype meter, which was a metal bar located in Sèvres. This also made obsolete the 1927 definition of 
 the ångström based on the red cadmium spectral line, replacing it with 1 Å = 10−10 m. The krypton-86 definition lasted until the October 1983 conference, which redefined the meter as the distance
 that light travels in vacuum during 1/299,792,458 s.

<h1>Rubidium</h1>
<p>
 Rubidium is a chemical element; it has symbol Rb and atomic number 37. It is a very soft, whitish-grey solid in the alkali metal group, 
 similar to potassium and caesium. Rubidium is the first alkali metal in the group to have a density higher than water. On Earth, 
 natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is a stable isotope 85Rb, and 28% is slightly radioactive 87Rb, with a half-life of 
 48.8 billion years – more than three times as long as the estimated age of the universe.<br>

German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 by the newly developed technique, flame spectroscopy. 
 The name comes from the Latin word rubidus, meaning deep red, the color of its emission spectrum. Rubidium's compounds have various 
 chemical and electronic applications. Rubidium metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range, making it a 
 frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms.[9] Rubidium is not a known nutrient for any living organisms. However, rubidium ions 
 have similar properties and the same charge as potassium ions, and are actively taken up and treated by animal cells in similar ways.

<h1>Strontium</h1>
<p>
 Strontium is a chemical element; it has symbol Sr and atomic number 38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic 
 element that is highly chemically reactive. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has physical and chemical properties 
 similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally mainly in the minerals celestine and strontianite, 
 and is mostly mined from these.<br>

Both strontium and strontianite are named after Strontian, a village in Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by 
 Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it was identified as a new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. 
 Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then newly discovered process of electrolysis. During the 19th century, 
 strontium was mostly used in the production of sugar from sugar beets (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode-ray tubes, 
 as much as 75% of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass. With the replacement of cathode-ray tubes with other 
 display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.<br>

While natural strontium (which is mostly the isotope strontium-88) is stable, the synthetic strontium-90 is radioactive and is one of the most 
dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the 
other hand, is not hazardous to health.

 <div id="yt">
<h1>Yttrium</h1>
<p>
 Yttrium is a chemical element; it has symbol Y and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and 
 has often been classified as a "rare-earth element". Yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements in rare-earth minerals 
 and is never found in nature as a free element. 89Y is the only stable isotope and the only isotope found in the Earth's crust.<br>

The most important present-day use of yttrium is as a component of phosphors, especially those used in LEDs. Historically, it was once widely used in 
 the red phosphors in television set cathode ray tube displays. Yttrium is also used in the production of electrodes, electrolytes, electronic filters, 
 lasers, superconductors, various medical applications, and tracing various materials to enhance their properties.<br>

Yttrium has no known biological role. Exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans.

 <div id="zr">
<h1>Zirconium</h1>
<p>
 Zirconium is a chemical element; it has symbol Zr and atomic number 40. First identified in 1789, isolated in impure form in 1824, and manufactured at scale 
 by 1925, pure zirconium is a lustrous transition metal with a greyish-white color that closely resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, titanium. 
 It is solid at room temperature, ductile, malleable and corrosion-resistant. The name zirconium is derived from the name of the mineral zircon, the 
 most important source of zirconium. The word is related to Persian zargun (zircon; zar-gun, "gold-like" or "as gold"). Besides zircon, zirconium 
 occurs in over 140 other minerals, including baddeleyite and eudialyte; most zirconium is produced as a byproduct of minerals mined for titanium and tin.<br>

Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic compounds, such as zirconium dioxide, and organometallic compounds, such as zirconocene dichloride. 
 Five isotopes occur naturally, four of which are stable. The metal and its alloys are mainly used as a refractory and opacifier; pure 
 zirconium plays a vital role in the construction of nuclear reactors due to strong resistance to corrosion and low nuclear reaction cross section, 
 and in space vehicles and turbine blades where high heat resistance is necessary. Zirconium also finds uses in flashbulbs, biomedical applications 
 such as dental implants and prosthetics, deodorant, and water purification systems.<br>

Zirconium compounds have no known biological role, though the element is widely distributed in nature and appears in small quantities in biological 
 systems without adverse effects. There is no indication of zirconium as a carcinogen. The main hazards posed by zirconium are flammability in powder 
 form and irritation of the eyes.

 <div id="nb">
<h1>Niobium</h1>
<p>
 Niobium is a chemical element; it has symbol Nb (formerly columbium, Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a light grey, crystalline, and ductile transition metal. 
 Pure niobium has a Mohs hardness rating similar to pure titanium,[6] and it has similar ductility to iron. Niobium oxidizes in Earth's atmosphere very slowly, 
 hence its application in jewelry as a hypoallergenic alternative to nickel. Niobium is often found in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite. Its name comes 
 from Greek mythology: Niobe, daughter of Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical
 and chemical properties, which makes them difficult to distinguish.<br>

English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly
 concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named 
 niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a 
 century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use 
 in metallurgy in the United States.<br>

It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Niobium is an important addition to high-strength low-alloy steels. Brazil is 
 the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of 60–70% niobium with iron. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel 
 such as that used in gas pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel by 
 scavenging carbide and nitride. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines.<br>

Niobium is used in various superconducting materials. These alloys, also containing titanium and tin, are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners.
 Other applications of niobium include welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics, and jewelry. In the last two applications, the low toxicity
 and iridescence produced by anodization are highly desired properties. Niobium is considered a technology-critical element.

<div id="mo">
<h1>Molybdenum</h1>
<p>
 Molybdenum is a chemical element; it has symbol Mo (from Neo-Latin molybdaenum) and atomic number 42. The name derived from Ancient Greek Μόλυβδος molybdos, 
 meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores.[10] Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered 
 (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated
 in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.<br>

Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; in its minerals, it is found only in oxidized states. The free element, a silvery metal with
 a grey cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of the world 
 production of the element (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys.<br>

Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water. Heating molybdenum-bearing minerals under oxygen and water affords molybdate ion 
 MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, which forms quite soluble salts. Industrially, molybdenum compounds (about 14% of world production of the element) are used as 
 pigments and catalysts.<br>

Molybdenum-bearing enzymes are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking the chemical bond in atmospheric molecular nitrogen in the process of 
 biological nitrogen fixation. At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria, plants, and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes
 are involved in nitrogen fixation. Most nitrogenases contain an iron–molybdenum cofactor FeMoco, which is believed to contain either Mo(III) or Mo(IV).
 By contrast Mo(VI) and Mo(IV) are complexed with molybdopterin in all other molybdenum-bearing enzymes.[14] Molybdenum is an essential element for all higher 
 eukaryote organisms, including humans. A species of sponge, Theonella conica, is known for hyperaccumulation of molybdenum.

 <div id="tc">
<h1>Technetium</h1>
<p>
 Technetium is a chemical element; it has symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive. 
 Technetium and promethium are the only radioactive elements whose neighbours in the sense of atomic number are both stable. All available 
 technetium is produced as a synthetic element. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore and thorium ore 
 (the most common source), or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. This silvery gray, crystalline transition metal lies between 
 manganese and rhenium in group 7 of the periodic table, and its chemical properties are intermediate between those of both adjacent elements. 
 The most common naturally occurring isotope is 99Tc, in traces only.<br>

Many of technetium's properties had been predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before it was discovered; Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and 
 gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese (Em). In 1937, technetium became the first predominantly artificial element to be 
 produced, hence its name (from the Greek technetos, 'artificial', + -ium).<br>

One short-lived gamma ray–emitting nuclear isomer, technetium-99m, is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of tests, such as bone cancer diagnoses. 
 The ground state of the nuclide technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray–free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially 
 are byproducts of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because even the longest-lived isotope of 
 technetium has a relatively short half-life (4.21 million years), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants helped to prove that stars can 
 produce heavier elements.

 <div id="ru">
<h1>Ruthenium</h1>
<p>
 Ruthenium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. 
 Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is unreactive to most chemicals. Karl Ernst Claus, a Russian scientist of Baltic-German ancestry, 
 discovered the element in 1844 at Kazan State University and named it in honor of Russia, using the Latin name Ruthenia. Ruthenium is usually found as a
 minor component of platinum ores; the annual production has risen from about 19 tonnes in 2009 to some 35.5 tonnes in 2017. Most ruthenium produced 
 is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst. 
 A new application of ruthenium is as the capping layer for extreme ultraviolet photomasks. Ruthenium is generally found in ores with the other platinum group 
 metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury, 
 Ontario, and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa.

 <div id="rh">
<h1>Rhenium</h1>
<p>
 Rhenium is a chemical element; it has symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-gray, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. 
 With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. It has one of the highest
 melting and boiling points of any element. It resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and 
 refinement of molybdenum and copper ores. It shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.<br>

Rhenium was originally discovered in 1908 by Masataka Ogawa, but he mistakenly assigned it as element 43 rather than element 75 and named it nipponium. 
 It was rediscovered in 1925 by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke and Otto Berg, who gave it its present name. It was named after the river Rhine in Europe, 
 from which the earliest samples had been obtained and worked commercially.<br>

Nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines. These alloys contain up to 
 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element. The second-most important use is as a catalyst: it is an excellent 
 catalyst for hydrogenation and isomerization, and is used for example in catalytic reforming of naphtha for use in gasoline (rheniforming process).
 Because of the low availability relative to demand, rhenium is expensive, with price reaching an all-time high in 2008–09 of US$10,600 per kilogram (US$4,800 per pound).
 As of 2018, its price had dropped to US$2,844 per kilogram (US$1,290 per pound) due to increased recycling and a drop in demand for rhenium catalysts.

<h1>Paladium</h1>
<p>
 Palladium is a chemical element; it has symbol Pd and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1802 by the 
 English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas (formally 2 Pallas), which was itself named after the epithet of the 
 Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements 
 referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). They have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.<br>

More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases 
 in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into nontoxic substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor).
 Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry. 
 Palladium is a key component of fuel cells, in which hydrogen and oxygen react to produce electricity, heat, and water.<br>

Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex 
 covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa; the Stillwater Complex in Montana, United States; the Sudbury Basin and Thunder Bay District of Ontario, 
 Canada; and the Norilsk Complex in Russia. Recycling is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited 
 supply sources result in considerable investment interest.

<h1>Silver</h1>
<p>
 Silver is a chemical element; it has symbol Ag (from Latin argentum 'silver', derived from Proto-Indo-European *h₂erǵ 'shiny, white') 
 and atomic number 47. A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, 
 and reflectivity of any metal. Silver is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form ("native silver"), as an alloy 
 with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.<br>

Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it 
 is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; 
 a 94%-pure alloy is described as "0.940 fine". As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures.<br>

Other than in currency and as an investment medium (coins and bullion), silver is used in solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, 
 ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term "silverware"), in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors,
 window coatings, in catalysis of chemical reactions, as a colorant in stained glass, and in specialized confectionery. Its compounds are used 
 in photographic and X-ray film. Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides
 (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages, wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.

<h1>Cadmium</h1>
<p>
 Cadmium is a chemical element; it has symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals
 in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point 
 than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11. Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not 
 have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is 
 between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate.<br>

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. It was used for a long time in the 1900s as a corrosion-resistant
 plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange, and yellow pigments, to color glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium's use is generally 
 decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive ) and nickel–cadmium batteries have
 been replaced with nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. Due to it being a neutron poison, cadmium is also used as a component of control rods in 
 nuclear fission reactors. One of its few new uses is in cadmium telluride solar panels.<br>

Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent carbonic anhydrase has been found in marine diatoms.

 <div id="in">
<h1>Indium</h1>
<p>
 Indium is a chemical element; it has symbol In and atomic number 49. It is a silvery-white post-transition metal and one of the softest elements. 
 Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and its properties are largely intermediate between the two. It was discovered in 1863 
 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum.<br>

Indium is a technology-critical element used primarily in the production of flat-panel displays as indium tin oxide (ITO), a transparent and conductive 
 coating applied to glass. Indium is also used in the semiconductor industry,[16] in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders and 
 soft-metal high-vacuum seals. It is produced exclusively as a by-product during the processing of the ores of other metals, chiefly from sphalerite 
 and other zinc sulfide ores.<br>
 
Indium has no biological role and its compounds are toxic when inhaled or injected into the bloodstream, although they are poorly absorbed following ingestion.

 <div id="sn">
<h1>Tin</h1>
<p>
 Tin is a chemical element; it has symbol Sn (from Latin stannum) and atomic number 50. A silvery-colored metal, tin is soft enough to be cut with little force,
 and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals.<br>

Tin is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of elements. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains stannic oxide, 
 SnO<sub>2</sub>. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. 
 Tin is the 49th most abundant element on Earth, making up 0.00022% of its crust, and with 10 stable isotopes, it has the largest number of stable isotopes in the 
 periodic table, due to its magic number of protons.<br>

It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is β-tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal; at low temperatures it is less dense grey α-tin, 
 which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin does not easily oxidize in air and water.<br>

The first tin alloy used on a large scale was bronze, made of 1⁄8 tin and 7⁄8 copper (12.5% and 87.5% respectively), from as early as 3000 BC. 
 After 600 BC, pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85–90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony, 
 bismuth, and sometimes lead and silver, has been used for flatware since the Bronze Age. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably
 tin-lead soft solders, which are typically 60% or more tin, and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of indium tin oxide 
 in optoelectronic applications. Another large application is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel. Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, 
 tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as "tin cans". Some organotin compounds can be extremely toxic.

<h1>Antimony</h1>
<p>
 Antimony is a chemical element; it has symbol Sb (from Latin stibium) and atomic number 51. A lustrous grey metal or metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the 
 sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, 
 often known by the  Arabic name kohl.The earliest known description of this metalloid in the West was written in 1540 by Vannoccio Biringuccio.<br>

China is the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan. The industrial methods for refining 
 antimony from stibnite are roasting followed by reduction with carbon, or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.<br>

The most common applications for metallic antimony are in alloys with lead and tin, which have improved properties for solders, bullets, and plain bearings. 
 It improves the rigidity of lead-alloy plates in lead–acid batteries. Antimony trioxide is a prominent additive for halogen-containing flame retardants. 
 Antimony is used as a dopant in semiconductor devices.

 <div id="te">
<h1>Tellurium</h1>
<p>
 Tellurium is a chemical element; it has symbol Te and atomic number 52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is 
 chemically related to selenium and sulfur, all three of which are chalcogens. It is occasionally found in its native form as elemental crystals. 
 Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, 
 is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth.<br>
 
 Tellurium-bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in Kleinschlatten, Transylvania (now Zlatna, Romania) by Austrian mineralogist 
 Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein, although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin tellus 'earth'. 
 Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, 
 which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production.<br>

Commercially, the primary use of tellurium is CdTe solar panels and thermoelectric devices. A more traditional application in copper (tellurium copper) 
 and steel alloys, where tellurium improves machinability, also consumes a considerable portion of tellurium production. Tellurium is considered a 
 technology-critical element.<br>

Tellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine.
 In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium 
 exposure or poisoning.

 <div id="io">
<h1>Iodine</h1>
<p>
 Iodine is a chemical element; it has symbol I and atomic number 53. The heaviest of the stable halogens, it exists at standard conditions as a semi-lustrous, 
 non-metallic solid that melts to form a deep violet liquid at 114 °C (237 °F), and boils to a violet gas at 184 °C (363 °F). The element was discovered by 
 the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811 and was named two years later by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, after the Ancient Greek Ιώδης, meaning 'violet'.<br>

Iodine occurs in many oxidation states, including iodide (I<sup>-</sup>), iodate (IO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), and the various periodate anions. As the heaviest essential mineral nutrient, 
 iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of 
 intellectual disabilities.<br>

The dominant producers of iodine today are Chile and Japan. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, 
 it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material. Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive 
 isotopes of iodine can also be used to treat thyroid cancer. Iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers.<br>

It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

<h1>Xenon</h1>
<p>
 Xenon is a chemical element; it has symbol Xe and atomic number 54. It is a dense, colorless, odorless noble gas found in Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts.
 Although generally unreactive, it can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be 
 synthesized.<br>

Xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps, and as a general anesthetic. The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule (Xe<sub>2</sub>) as 
 the lasing medium, and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps. Xenon is also used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting 
 massive particles and as a propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft.<br>

Naturally occurring xenon consists of seven stable isotopes and two long-lived radioactive isotopes. More than 40 unstable xenon isotopes undergo radioactive decay, 
 and the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the Solar System. Radioactive xenon-135 is produced by beta decay 
 from iodine-135 (a product of nuclear fission), and is the most significant (and unwanted) neutron absorber in nuclear reactors.
